<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It is an encouraging sign of advancing culture that history
is gaining a deeper and broader meaning. We are
really becoming interested, not merely in our political, but
also in our entire biological, psychological, and social evolution.
Although such phrase-making is nearly always misleading,
there would perhaps be more truth in saying that
"history is past sociology and sociology present history"
than in Freeman's well-known epigram. In particular, the
human family, with all that the word connotes, is commanding
greater attention. Yet there is urgent need that its rise and
social function should have far more earnest study than they
now receive. The family and its cognate institutions ought
to enter more fully into popular thought; and they should
have much larger relative space in the educational program.
From the home circle to the university seminar they are
worthy to become a vital part of systematic social training.
In the hope of aiding somewhat in winning for them due
scientific recognition, this book is written. It seems not
impossible that a sustained history of the matrimonial institutions
of the English race in its "three homes" may prove
a positive advantage, especially in gathering the materials
and planning the work for more detailed investigations.
Moreover, a thorough understanding of the social evolution
of any people must rest upon the broader experience of mankind.
Accordingly, in Part I the attempt is made to present
a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the literature and
the theories of primitive matrimonial institutions.</p>

<p>Preliminary reference to another portion of the book may
perhaps be permitted. The anxious attention of the legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
and social reformer is being especially directed to the character
of our state legislation regarding marriage and divorce.
To him, therefore, it is hoped, the last three chapters may
prove helpful. Summaries of the statutes as they stood at
particular dates have indeed appeared. The digest contained
in the government <cite>Report</cite> is of great value for the
time of its compilation; but no attempt seems ever to have
been made to provide a systematic historical record. In
these chapters&mdash;the result of several years' labor&mdash;the laws
of all the states and territories enacted since the Revolution
have been analyzed with some regard for details. No pains
have been spared to gain accuracy; yet it would be rash to
expect that the discussion is entirely free from error or oversight.</p>

<p>During the years devoted to this investigation I have
profited by the generous assistance of many friends. They
have aided me through references, information, copying,
verifying, and in other ways. To all these I desire to convey
my grateful thanks. In a few instances it is fitting that
individual acknowledgment should be made. To Professor
William Henry Hudson, of London, I am indebted for the
examination of several rare books in the library of the British
Museum. Bibliographical help has also been given by
Professor Charles Richmond Henderson, of the University
of Chicago. Special researches on my behalf have been
conducted by Mr. Royall C. Victor and by Miss Lucile
Eaves, head resident of the South Park Settlement, San
Francisco. I have had the advantage of the expert aid of
Mr. David M. Matteson in examining the manuscript records
of the colonial and provincial courts of Suffolk and Middlesex
counties, Massachusetts. To Professor Nathan Abbott, of
Stanford University, Mr. James H. Deering, of the San
Francisco Law Library, and Rev. Samuel W. Dike, secretary
of the National League for the Protection of the Family, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
am under obligations for information and suggestions.
Special thanks are due to Professor Charles Gross, of Harvard,
for encouragement in the work and various kind offices;
as also to Mr. W. C. Lane and Mr. T. J. Kiernan, of the Harvard
Library, for granting the most liberal use of the
materials in their charge.</p>

<p>Finally I can but poorly express the gratitude which I
owe to my wife, whose patient hand, faithful criticism, and
wise counsel have never failed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

THE PATRIARCHAL THEORY</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note I.</span>&mdash;The modern history of the patriarchal
theory begins with Filmer's <cite>Patriarchia</cite> (London, 1680), in which the
author finds in the Hebrew family a justification of the "divine prerogative"
of kings; and the trenchant reply of Locke in <cite>The Two
Treatises on Civil Government</cite> (London, 1690), reprinted with Filmer's
work in the ninth volume of Morley's <cite>Universal Library</cite>. But the
theory is especially associated with the name of Sir Henry Maine. His
<cite>Ancient Law</cite> (New York, 1861), aside from its leading hypothesis, is
one of the most suggestive books of the century. It was followed by
the <cite>Early History of Institutions</cite> (New York, 1875); the <cite>Village Communities</cite>
(New York, 1876); and <cite>Early Law and Custom</cite> (New York,
1883). In this last work he contributes supplementary chapters on
such topics as "Ancestor-Worship" and "East European House Communities,"
and he replies to his critics. Maine is criticised by Spencer,
<cite>Principles of Sociology</cite> (New York, 1879), Vol. I, Part III, chap. ix; and
by McLennan, <cite>Patriarchal Theory</cite> (London, 1885), who, on the negative
side, is fairly successful in confuting his adversary. Hearn's <cite>Aryan
Household</cite> (London, 1879) and the <cite>Ancient City</cite> (Boston, 1877) of Fustel
de Coulanges take practically the same view of primitive society as
Maine, while particularly emphasizing ancestor-worship and the genealogical
organization.</p>

<p>For the early Aryans and the Hindus see Zimmer's <cite>Alt-indisches
Leben</cite> (Berlin, 1879); Delbrück's <cite>Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen</cite>
(Leipzig, 1885); Schrader's <cite>Sprachvergleichung und
Urgeschichte</cite> (Jena, 1883), or the English translation by Jevons (London,
1890); Zmigrodski's <cite>Die Mutter bei den Völkern des arischen
Stammes</cite> (Munich, 1886); and especially Leist's epoch-making works,
<cite>Graeco-italische Rechtsgeschichte</cite> (Jena, 1884) and the <cite>Alt-arisches Jus
Gentium</cite> (Jena, 1889). Of first-rate value also are the <cite>Rechtshistorische
und rechtsvergleichende Forschungen</cite> (Part III, on <cite>Indisches
Ehe- und Familienrecht</cite>) and the other papers of the indefatigable
Kohler. Of these the following are particularly interesting in this
connection, all found in the <cite>Zeitschrift für vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft</cite>:
"Rechtsverhältnisse auf dem ostind. Archipel u. den westl.
Karolinen," <cite>ZVR.</cite>, VI, 344-50; "Gewohnheitsrechte des Pendschabs,"
<i>ibid.</i>, VII, 161-239; "Indische Gewohnheitsrechte," <i>ibid.</i>, VIII, 89-147,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
262-73; "Gewohnheitsrechte von Bengalen," <i>ibid.</i>, IX, 321-60; "Gewohnheitsrechte
der Provinz Bombay," <i>ibid.</i>, X, 64-142, 161-88;
"Gewohnheitsrechte der ind. Nordwestprovinzen," <i>ibid.</i>, XI, 161-95;
and, for comparison, "Die Ionsage und Vaterrecht," <i>ibid.</i>, V, 407-14;
"Studien über künstliche Verwandtschaft," <i>ibid.</i>, V, 415-40; and "Das
Recht der Armenier," <i>ibid.</i>, VII, 385-436. As in the last-named paper,
the influence of Roman law may be traced in Mégavorian, <cite>Étude ethnographique
et juridique sur la famille et le mariage arméniens</cite> (Paris,
1894). Hass, "Die Heirathsgebrāuche der alten Inder nach den Grihyasûtra,"
in Weber's <cite>Indische Studien</cite>, V, 267-412 (Berlin, 1862), reveals
in an admirable way the religious spirit pervading the ancient Hindu
matrimonial life. This study suggested the excellent monograph of
Weber, "Vedische Hochzeitssprüche," <i>ibid.</i>, V, 177-266; while the conclusions
of both Haas and Weber are ably supported, with the aid of
additional sources, by the more elaborate paper of Winternitz, "Das
altindische Hochzeitsrituell," in <cite>Denkschriften der kais. Akad. d. Wiss.,
phil.-hist. Klasse</cite>, XL, 1-113 (Vienna, 1892). In this connection, for
comparison, may be read Mackenzie, "An Account of the Marriage
Ceremonies of the Hindus and Mahommedans as Practised in the
Southern Peninsula of India," in <cite>Transactions of the Royal Asiatic
Society</cite>, III (London, 1835); and Lushington, "On the Marriage Rites
and Usages of the Jâts of Bharatpur," in <cite>Journal of the Asiatic Society
of Bengal</cite>, II, 273-97 (Calcutta, 1833). Especially important are Bernhöft's
"Die Grundlagen der Rechtsentwicklung bei den indogermanischen
Völkern," in <cite>ZVR.</cite>, II, 253-328; his "Altindisches Familienorganisation,"
<i>ibid.</i>, IX, 1-45; and his "Das Gesetz von Gortyn," <i>ibid.</i>,
VI, 281-304, 430-40. A popular, but in the main uncritical, book is
Clarisse Bader's <cite>La femme dans l'Inde antique</cite> (2d ed., Paris, 1867).
Similar in plan and treatment are her <cite>La femme biblique</cite> (new ed.,
Paris, 1873); <cite>La femme grecque</cite> (2d ed., Paris, 1873); and <cite>La femme
romaine</cite> (2d ed., Paris, 1877). A strong defense of the dignified position
of the ancient Indic woman, based on the sources, may be found
in Jacolliot's <cite>La femme dans l'Inde</cite> (Paris, 1877); and Mary Frances
Billington is a vigorous champion of the social status of modern
<cite>Woman in India</cite> (London, 1895). See also Pizzi, "Les coutumes nuptiales
aux temps héroïques de l'Iran," in <cite>La Muséon</cite>, II, 3 (1883); Vidyasagar,
<cite>On Widow-Marriages among the Hindus</cite> (Calcutta, 1855); and
Schlagintweit, "Die Hindu-Wittwe in Indien," in <cite>Globus</cite>, XLIII (1883).
Among the best technical writings are Mayne's <cite>Hindu Law and Usage</cite>
(Madras and London, 1888); Jolly's <cite>Hindu Law of Partition</cite> (Calcutta,
1885); his <cite>Rechtliche Stellung der Frauen bei den alten Indern</cite>
(Munich, 1876); Tupper's <cite>Punjab Customary Law</cite> (Calcutta, 1881); and
Gooroodass's "The Hindu Law of Marriage and Stridahn," in <cite>Tagore
Law Lectures, 1878</cite> (Calcutta, 1879). Max Müller's series of Sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Books contains Apastamba, Gautama, Visnu, and the other Sūtras, as
well as the later versified law-books of Manu and Yājñavalkya, with
other sources of ancient Indic custom. Burnell and Hopkins's <cite>Manu</cite>
(London, 1891) is an excellent edition; and Jolly has a German translation
of Books VIII and IX in <cite>ZVR.</cite>, III, 232-83; IV, 321-61. For each
important point these sources are thoroughly collated in the writings
of Kohler, Leist, and Jolly, above referred to.</p>

<p>For the Slavs, Krauss's <cite>Sitte und Brauch der Südslaven</cite> (Vienna,
1885) is the most valuable treatise. See also Turner, <cite>Slavisches Familienrecht</cite>
(Strassburg, 1874); and Kovalevsky's <cite>Modern Customs and
Ancient Laws of Russia</cite> (London, 1891), in which the author criticises
and corrects Sir Henry Maine on important points. For Greece, in
addition to Leist's works above mentioned, see the paper of Campaux,
<cite>Du mariage à Athènes</cite> (Paris, 1867); that of Moy, "La famille dans
Homère," in <cite>Revue des cours littéraires</cite>, 8 mars 1869; Stegeren, <cite>De
conditione civili feminarum atheniensium</cite> (Zwallae, 1839); Ouvré,
<cite>Observations sur le régime matrimonial au temps d'Homère</cite> (Paris,
1886); Lasaulx, <cite>Zur Geschichte und Philosophie der Ehe bei den
Griechen</cite> (Munich, 1852); especially Hruza's <cite>Die Ehebegründung nach
attischem Rechte</cite> (Erlangen and Leipzig, 1892); and his <cite>Polygamie und
Pellikat nach griechischem Rechte</cite> (Erlangen and Leipzig, 1894).</p>

<p>On the matrimonial institutions of the Romans consult Marquardt's
<cite>Privatleben</cite>; Lange's <cite>Römische Alterthümer</cite>; Smith's <cite>Dictionary of
Greek and Roman Antiquities</cite>; Müller's <cite>Handbuch</cite>; Bernhöft's <cite>Staat
und Recht der rom. Königszeit</cite> (Stuttgart, 1882); Karlowa's <cite>Die Formen
der röm. Ehe und Manus</cite> (Bonn, 1868); Rossbach's <cite>Die röm. Ehe</cite>
(Stuttgart, 1853); his <cite>Römische Hochzeits- und Ehedenkmäler</cite> (Leipzig,
1871); Laband's "Rechtliche Stellung der Frauen im altröm. und germanischen
Recht," in <cite>Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie</cite>, III (Berlin,
1865); and Bouchez-Leclercq's <cite>Manuel des inst. romaines</cite> (Paris, 1886).
From the mass of writings which are of service for this and the four subsequent
chapters may also be mentioned Brissonius, <cite>De ritu nuptiarum</cite>
(Paris, 1564); his <cite>De jure connubiorum</cite> (Paris, 1564); Hotman, <cite>De veteri
ritu nuptiarum observatio</cite>; his <cite>De sponsalibus</cite>; his <cite>De ritu nuptiarum
et jure matrimoniorum</cite>&mdash;all published and bound with the two works of
Brissonius (Leyden, 1641); Grupen, <cite>De uxore romana</cite> (Hannover, 1727);
Ayrer, <cite>De jure connubiorum apud romanos</cite> (Göttingen, 1736); the
anonymous <cite>Dei riti delle antiche nozze romane</cite> (Perugia, 1791);
Maanen, <cite>De muliere in manu et in tutela</cite> (Lugd. Bat., 1823); Schultz,
<cite>De jure succedendi feminarum apud romanos</cite> (Trajecti ad Rhenum,
1826); Chamblain, <cite>De la puissance paternelle chez les romains</cite> (Paris,
1829); Eggers, <cite>Wesen und Eigenthümlichkeiten der altröm. Ehe mit
Manus</cite> (Altona, 1833); Mahlmann, <cite>De matrimonii veterum romanorum
ineundi</cite> (Halle, 1845); Hase, <cite>De manu juris romani</cite> (Halle, 1847);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Gerlach, <cite>De romanorum connubio</cite> (Halle, 1851); Dubief, <cite>Qualis
fuerit familia romana tempore Plauti</cite> (Molini, 1859); Pagés, <cite>La famille
romaine</cite> (Toulouse, 1892); Louïse, <cite>Du sénatus-consulte velléien et de
l'incapacité de la femme mariée</cite> (Chateau-Thierry, 1873); Bourdin, <cite>De la
condition de la mère en droit romain et en droit français</cite> (Paris, 1881);
Salomon, <cite>Du mariage du droit des gens et en général des mariages
sans connubium</cite> (Paris, 1889); Desminis, <cite>Die Eheschenkung nach
röm. und insbesondere nach byzantinischem Recht</cite> (Athens, 1897); and
Ciccotti, <cite>Donne e politica negli ultimi anni della republica romana</cite>
(Milan, 1895). The criticisms of Kuntze, <cite>Excurse über röm. Recht</cite> (2d
ed., Leipzig, 1880), and Esmein, <cite>Mélanges d'histoire du droit et de
critique</cite> (Paris, 1886), are of great value on various important questions.
Compare also Couch, "Woman in Early Roman Law," in <cite>Harvard Law
Review</cite>, VIII (Cambridge, 1895); Picot, <cite>Du mariage romain, chrétien, et
français</cite> (Paris, 1849); Monlezun, <cite>Condition civile de la femme mariée à
Rome et en France</cite> (Paris, 1878); Tardieu, <cite>De la puissance paternelle en
droit romain et en droit français</cite> (Paris, 1875); and Cornil, "Contribution
à l'étude de la patria potestas," in <cite>Nouv. rev. hist. de droit</cite>, XXI,
416-85 (Paris, 1897). Gide's excellent <cite>Étude sur la condition privée
de la femme</cite> (2d ed., Paris, 1885) deals with the laws of Greece, Rome,
and other nations. Poste's edition of Gaius's <cite>Institutionum juris
civilis commentarii quatuor</cite> (Oxford, 1875) is an indispensable source;
and among legal treatises are particularly to be commended Muirhead's
<cite>Introduction to the Private Law of Rome</cite> (Edinburgh, 1886);
Puchta's <cite>Institutionen</cite>; Moyle's <cite>Institutionum Libri</cite> (Oxford, 1890);
Rein, <cite>Privatrecht</cite> (Leipzig, 1836); and especially Sohm's <cite>Institutes</cite>
(Oxford, 1892), by far the best work on the subject for historical purposes,
showing the rare insight, clearness of analysis, and vigorous
style peculiar to the author. Most readers will find the short <cite>Introduction</cite>
of Hadley and the excellent <cite>Outlines</cite> of Professor Morey sufficient.
For the general subject of marriage and the family the <cite>Zeitschrift
für vergleichende Rechtswissenchaft</cite> (Stuttgart, 1878-96) is indispensable;
while the <cite>Kritische Vierteljahresschrift für Gesetzgebung
und Rechtswissenschaft</cite> and the <cite>Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</cite> are also of
constant service.</p>

<p>For the literature of Arabian and Hebrew matrimonial institutions,
respectively, see Bibliographical Notes II and IV.</p>

<p>The student who has not yet seriously attacked the literature
of the subject will do well to begin with the following: Tylor, "On a
Method of Investigating the Development of Institutions, Applied to
Laws of Marriage and Descent," in <cite>Journal of Anth. Inst.</cite>, XVIII,
No. 3; Bernhöft's "Zur Geschichte des europäischen Familienrechts,"
in <cite>ZVR.</cite>, VIII, 1-27, 161-221, 384-405; in connection with his "Principien
des europäischen Familienrechts," <i>ibid.</i>, IX, 392-444; Friedrichs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
"Familien-Stufen und Eheformen," <i>ibid.</i>, X, 189-281; the first two
chapters of Posada's <cite>Théories modernes</cite> (Paris, 1896); and the first
three chapters of Botsford's <cite>Athenian Constitution</cite> (Boston, 1893), one
of the ablest contributions to comparative institutions. This is supplemented
by H. E. Seebohm's <cite>Structure of Greek Tribal Society</cite>
(London and New York, 1895). For summaries of the results of investigations,
from different points of view, Delbrück's "Das Mutterrecht bei
den Indogermanen," in <cite>Preussische Jahrbücher</cite>, XCVII, 14-27 (Berlin,

<p>It is the primary purpose of this book to trace the
development of the family and marriage in the "three
homes" of the English race. An attempt is made to
describe the mechanism provided by the state for the administration
of matrimonial law; and to appreciate the importance
of some of the many problems centering in the family
as a social institution. Necessarily a theme so broad may
here be treated only in outline. Yet in the outset it is the
limitations of the subject which require to be most carefully
noted. It is but a part of the wide field of family history
which receives special attention. We are closely concerned
with the forms of celebration and divorce as they existed
among our Teutonic ancestors, and as they have since been
molded by custom and legislation in England and the United
States. Only in a secondary degree are we interested in the
intricate law of the domestic relations. Except incidentally,
we are not now called upon to consider the property rights
of husband and wife, the laws of guardian and ward, or the
rules of kinship and succession.</p>

<p>More pertinent is the general question of the genesis
of human marriage and the human family.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
impossible, of course, to examine independently the many
difficult problems which have arisen in this connection.
Even the specialist may find it hard to trace a clear way
through the bewildering maze of existing theory and sub-theory.
It seems desirable, therefore, by way of introduction,
to present as clearly and briefly as may be the more
salient results of recent investigation. Marriage is a product
of social experience. Hence to understand its modern
aspects it is needful to appeal to the general sociological
facts surrounding its origin and its early history among
the races of mankind. It is necessary to get our bearings.
At the dawn of history the Teutonic family was essentially
monogamic, originating in a contractual relation. What,
then, do we know as to the origin of the monogamic family
and regarding the conditions under which marriage by contract
arose? Part I will concern itself with the solution of
this question.</p>

<p>The literature<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of primitive marriage and the family is
already formidable; and, however contradictory and discouraging,
on first examination, its conclusions may appear,
there can be little doubt that they demonstrate the possibilities
of the comparative method<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in the domain of social
institutions. It is in this field, indeed, that evolutional
science bids fair to achieve its most signal triumph. At last,
in the laboratory of science, there is some prospect that man
may come really to know himself. On the other hand, it is
precisely in the study of primitive marriage that the "perils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of historical narrative" are most clearly revealed.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Nowhere,
perhaps, can there be found rasher inference<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and more
sweeping generalization from inadequate data. Too often
economic and psychological laws have been slighted; and,
in a field where their careful observance is so vitally important,
the fundamental principles of organic evolution&mdash;such,
for instance, as natural selection&mdash;have frequently been
ignored.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A vast mass of interesting facts relating to man's
social development, highly important for him to know, has
been disclosed. But, with a few notable exceptions, the
signal failure of investigators thus far has been the attempt
to sustain theories of uniform social progress. The criticism,
especially, to which the writings of Bachofen, Maine,
Morgan, and McLennan have given rise has greatly weakened
the faith of scholars in the doctrine of universal stages
of evolution through which all mankind has run.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>


<h3>I. STATEMENT OF THE THEORY</h3>

<p>Students of comparative institutions have generally regarded
the family as the unit or germ from which the
higher forms of social organism have been evolved. A German
scholar declares that among all the races of antiquity
"the constitution of the family was the basis and prototype<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of the constitution of the state."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The same theory is clearly
set forth and the process of political expansion carefully
described by Plato and also by Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> who base it upon
their own observation both among "Hellenes and barbarians,"
and each illustrates it by reference to the Cyclops of
Homer.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is not wholly improbable, as will presently
appear, that the family in some form must be accepted as
the initial society, possibly among all the races of mankind.
At a very early ethnical period the family, so far as it implies
great authority, perhaps even the despotic power of the
house-father over his wife and children, may often have been
"patriarchal." To admit this, however, is very different
from accepting as the primordial cell of social development
the strictly defined patriarchal family of Sir Henry Maine's
<cite>Ancient Law</cite>. In this book, which made its appearance in
1861, we are told that the "effect of the evidence derived
from comparative jurisprudence is to establish that view of
the primeval condition of the human race which is known as
the Patriarchal Theory."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The primitive family as thus conceived
is substantially the Roman family, not in all respects
as it actually appears in the historical period, but as it is
thought that it must have been before the process of transformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and decay began. It is a much more extended
group than the modern family, embracing under the headship
of the eldest valid male parent all agnatic descendants
and all persons united to it by adoption, as well as slaves,
clients, and other dependents.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The power of the house-father
is most despotic, though exercised during his entire
lifetime over the unmarried daughters and over even the
married sons and their wives and children. Thus originally,
it is said, the Roman <i>pater familias</i> has power of life and
death, <i>vita necisque</i>, over his children. He may sell them
into slavery, and sons, even those who hold the highest
offices of state, can originally own no property.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The patriarch
is king and priest of the household. As a sort of
"corporation sole," he is likewise its representative and
administrator; for the property is regarded as a part of the
family, and on the death of the house-father the family
devolves upon the universal successor.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> A characteristic
feature of the patriarchal family is agnation, or the system
of tracing kinship through males only.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Agnatic relationship
"is in truth the connection between members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
family, conceived as it was in the most ancient times."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Its
foundation is "not the marriage of father and mother, but
the authority of the father.... In truth, in the primitive
view, relationship is exactly limited by <i>patria potestas</i>.
Where the <i>potestas</i> begins, kinship begins; and therefore
adoptive relatives are among the kindred. Where the
<i>potestas</i> ends, kinship ends; so that a son emancipated by
his father loses all rights of agnation. And here we have
the reason why the descendants of females are outside the
limits of archaic kinship." Indeed "it is obvious that the
organization of primitive societies would have been confounded,
if men had called themselves relatives of their
mother's relatives."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The basis of the patriarchal family
is the <i>patria potestas</i>, but in its "normal shape" it has not
been and could not be "generally a durable institution."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Yet its former universality may be inferred from certain
derivative institutions, such as the perpetual tutelage of
women, the guardianship of minors, the relation of master
and slave, and especially from agnation which is found
"almost everywhere" and is "as it were a mould" retaining
the imprint of the paternal powers after they have ceased to
exist.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Applying this test chiefly, Maine finds evidence of
the existence of the <i>potestas</i> among the Hebrews as well as
all the peoples of the Aryan stock; and he believes that it
would be hard to say "of what races of men it is <em>not</em> allowable
to lay down that the society in which they are united
was originally organized on the patriarchal model."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The patriarchal family as thus constituted is the "type
of an archaic society in all the modifications which it was
capable of assuming." From it as in concentric circles
have been successively evolved all the higher forms of political
organization. Everywhere, as at Rome, "the aggregation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of families forms the gens or house. The aggregation
of houses makes the tribe. The aggregation of tribes constitutes
the commonwealth."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The state is therefore the
result of the expansion of its primordial cell;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and the genealogical
organization of society precedes and overlaps the
territorial. All these groups, lower and higher, regard
themselves as united by the bond of kinship. But, as a
matter of fact, the kinship is often assumed; and the heterogeneity
of blood is explained as the result of the fiction of
adoption by which relationship is artificially extended and
strangers are admitted to the <i>sacra</i>. Without this fiction,
says Maine, "I do not see how any one of the primitive
groups, whatever were their nature, could have absorbed
another, or on what terms any two of them could have combined,
except those of absolute superiority on one side and
absolute subjection on the other." Society could hardly
have escaped from its "swaddling clothes."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Furthermore,
a strong motive for the artificial extension of the family is
derived from the worship of ancestors. The earnest desire
of the ancients for male issue to perpetuate the family rites
has tended to foster adoption, and it probably accounts for
the levirate and other similar expedients to provide an heir.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<h3>II. CRITICISM OF THE THEORY BY SPENCER
AND McLENNAN</h3>

<p>The patriarchal family of the <i>Ancient Law</i>, whose leading
features have now been presented, reappears with slight
modification in the later writings of Sir Henry Maine.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It
has been widely accepted. Yet it was inevitable that a
theory which on its face appears to neglect many of the most
remarkable facts everywhere observable in the social life of
primitive men<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> should arouse most serious doubt. Nor will
it do, with Starcke,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> to excuse the author on the ground that
his conclusions are intended to be true only for the domain
of the law-books, of comparative jurisprudence; for obviously
his language will not bear that construction.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer was the first writer to subject Maine's
hypothesis to a luminous criticism.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> First he points out that
Maine has not been entirely guiltless of "the lofty contempt"
entertained by civilized peoples for their barbarous neighbors,
which he himself censures as a serious error. For he "has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
practically disregarded the great mass of the uncivilized"
peoples, and "ignored the vast array of facts they present at
variance with his theory." Nor, in favor of a primitive
patriarchal state, is it safe to assume that "the implicit
obedience of rude men to their parents is doubtless a
primary fact." For, "though among lower races, sons, while
young, may be subordinate, from lack of ability to resist;
yet that they remain subordinate when they become men
cannot be assumed as a uniform, and therefore as a primary,
fact." This objection is sustained by reference to many
savage and barbarous tribes among which parents exercise
little or no control over the children. Again, it is by no
means established that "the history of political ideas begins,
in fact, with the assumption that kinship in blood is the sole
possible ground of community in political functions." On
the contrary, "political co-operation arises from the conflicts
of social groups with one another;"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and though it may be
facilitated by a feeling of common descent, examples of
political combination may be produced in which relationship
is not considered. Furthermore, it is hard to conceive how
so advanced a conception of government as is implied by the
<i>patria potestas</i> could exist in the "infancy of society;" nor
has it yet been proved that in the primitive state the individual
is entirely lost in the family group, which holds all
property in common. Instances of "personal monopoly" of
property among low races are not wanting. Finally the
assumption that in the primordial state women remained in
perpetual tutelage is without foundation; how far it is from
the truth will be made clear in future chapters.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>But the patriarchal theory has been vigorously attacked
in its very strongholds, the laws of the Hebrews and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
primitive customs of the Indo-Germanic peoples. The well-known
polemic of the late J. F. McLennan is of special
interest in this connection.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Among none of the Aryan
races, the Romans only excepted, does he find the <i>patria
potestas</i> or the strict rule of agnation; while among them
all, he believes, abundant evidence of original promiscuity
and of the maternal system of kinship is disclosed. Even
the Hebrew Scriptures, where Maine perceives "the chief
lineaments" of the patriarchal society,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> so far from revealing
the <i>patria potestas</i> and agnation, bear witness to
"beena"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> marriage and the recognition of kinship in
the female line.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Sir Henry Maine in this connection
refers incidentally to Sir Robert Filmer in whose <cite>Patriarchia</cite>
the existence of the <i>patria potestas</i> among the ancient
Hebrews is alleged. But, as McLennan justly observes, "to
those who have studied the controversy between Locke and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Filmer<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> it may seem wonderful that the truth of Filmer's
main position could be thus lightly assumed by anyone, and
especially by any lawyer, who had read Locke's masterly
reply to the pleadings of his opponent."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The principal
conclusions of McLennan are sustained in a striking way,
for a sister-branch of the Semitic race, by the researches of
Wilken and Robertson Smith into the marriage customs of
early Arabia.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The ancient Hebrews did not have agnation;
yet they "traced descent from the father for the purposes of
what we may call rank, or a feeling of <em>caste</em>," and this was
the source of paternal power.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The house-father exercised
a high degree of authority over his wives and children, but
he can scarcely be regarded as a patriarch in the strict sense
of the term.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<h3>III. THE THEORY IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT RESEARCH</h3>

<p>Let us now see somewhat more in detail what light is
thrown by recent investigation on the controversy between
Maine and McLennan. Westermarck has taken great pains
to enumerate the uncivilized peoples, chiefly non-Aryan,
among whom descent and usually inheritance follow the
paternal side;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and he finds that the number is "scarcely
less" than the number of those among whom the female line
is exclusively recognized. But in many of these cases it
seems probable that the parental rather than the agnatic
system prevails, though the male line may take precedence.
In some instances rank or authority descends from father to
son, while in other respects the female line predominates.
Doubtless more frequently than is usually imagined a mixed
system rather than a strictly paternal or a strictly maternal
system would be found to exist.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> As the result of his inquiry,
Westermarck rejects the hypothesis that kinship through the
mother is a primitive and universal stage, though he does
not substitute the agnatic theory in its place. Starcke, on
the other hand, after an extended examination of the customs
of rude races, especially in America and Australia, suggests
that the paternal as a general rule probably preceded the
maternal system which arose only with the development of
the gentile organization.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But Starcke's evidence can scarcely
be accepted as convincing.</p>

<p>Similar difficulties are presented by the question of the
prevalence of the so-called patriarchal power among non-Aryan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
races. Many apparent examples of despotic authority
can be enumerated;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> but it is often hard to determine whether,
as in the cases of the Arabs and Hebrews, we have to do
merely with a high degree of power on the part of the house-father
or with a genuine <i>patria potestas</i> of the Roman type.
Naturally, as Westermarck suggests, the father's authority
among savages "depends exclusively, or chiefly, upon his
superior strength;"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> while anything like a patriarchal "system"
can only arise later under the influence of ancestor-worship
and more developed social and industrial conditions.
Where authority depends solely or mainly upon brute force,
it is evident that a very protracted patriarchal despotism over
the sons is hard to conceive. Moreover, much error has
doubtless arisen through falsely assuming that paternal
authority and mother-right are incompatible; whereas they
may well coexist, as will presently appear.</p>

<p>For the Indo-Germanic or Aryan peoples the investigations
of Zimmer, Schrader, Delbrück, Kohler, and especially
the researches of Leist, enable us to speak with a higher
degree of confidence, though only for the period covered by
positive linguistic and legal evidence. Bachofen, McLennan,
and after them many other writers,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> as will later be shown,
have maintained that among all branches of the Aryan stock
conclusive proofs exist of a former matriarchate, or, at any
rate, of exclusive succession in the female line. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
view is decidedly rejected, if not entirely overthrown, by the
philologists, and depends for its support on the presence in
later institutions of alleged survivals. The judgment of
Delbrück must probably be accepted as decisive for the
present state of linguistic, if not of all scientific, inquiry.
He declares that "no sure traces of a former maternal family
among the Indo-Germanic peoples have been produced."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Similar conclusions are reached by Schrader, Max Müller,
and Leist.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Also, among the institutional writers, Wake
declares that "primitively among the peoples belonging to
the wide-spread Aryan or Indo-European stock, while relationship
was acknowledged through both parents, descent
was traced preferably in the male line;"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and Bernhöft, constrained
through the evidence presented by Schrader and
Delbrück, believes that it is now placed "beyond question
that the primitive Aryans did not live according to mother-right,"
but were united in family groups resembling the
south Slavonian house communities.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> On the other hand,
Dargun, the foremost defender of the theory of mother-right,
thinks that Bernhöft has "capitulated" too easily.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
last monograph, entitled <cite>Mutterrecht und Vaterrecht</cite>, he
maintains essentially the conclusion of his <cite>Mutterrecht und
Raubehe</cite>, that before their separation the Aryan people had
developed the system of kinship "through the mother as
the only or chief basis of blood-relationship" and had "subordinated
their entire family law to this principle."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> But
the later treatise contains a very important modification, or
perhaps, more justly speaking, extension, of the author's
theory. Setting aside as still an open question the general
prevalence of promiscuity or sexual communism at the very
dawn of distinctively human life, Dargun conceives that,
before any system of kinship, maternal or agnatic, became
recognized as a principle of customary family law, there must
have existed a family, or rather parent-group (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Elterngruppe</i>),
in which the father was protector and master of the mother
and her children. This parent-group is the "hypothetical
primordial cell of the family," brought together by sexual
requirements and the need of sustenance and protection. It
is "structureless, devoid of any firm bond, since it rests
neither upon the principle of relationship nor that of legalized
power." Its resemblance to the patriarchal family, though
misleading, "is not without significance." For it "forms
the necessary stage of an evolution which in analogous manner
is also passed through by property. Inductively it is
still demonstrable that individualism and atomism, not communism,
as is usually assumed, are the starting point of
evolution."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> As a general rule, according to Dargun, the
structureless parent-group is superseded by the maternal
family, whose basis is mother-right, or the exclusive legal
recognition of blood-relationship in the female line. Only
in rare cases does the patriarchal agnatic family follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
immediately upon the primitive group, without prior development
of mother-right;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and hence, under exceptional conditions
hindering the rise of the maternal system, do we find
a form of the family in which, from a very early period, the
house-father is the source of authority, practical or legalized.</p>

<p>Aside from his theory of evolution, in his principal thesis,
which he fairly sustains by powerful argument, Dargun has
rendered to science a distinct service. It is, he insists,
highly necessary carefully to distinguish between <em>power</em> and
<em>relationship</em>. "Mother-right" does not involve "maternal
power" or the matriarchate, though sometimes actually
united with it; nor does the headship of the house-father as
provider, protector, and master imply agnation, the so-called
"father-right." There is no contrast between power and
relationship. "Mother-right in the sense of exclusive maternal
kinship is compatible with a patriarchate just as
exclusive." They may, and often do, coexist. It follows
that the presence of the maternal system of kinship does not
imply the existence of maternal power; just as it does not
imply the non-existence of paternal authority. The distinction
between power and kinship is justly declared to be an
"indispensable key" for the solution of the greatest difficulties
arising in this branch of sociological science, the disregard
of which has often vitiated or confused the argument
even of the foremost investigators.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> With the aid of his key
Dargun examines the linguistic evidence, which he finds
favorable to the existence of mother-right among all the
Aryan peoples after the separation, though united with a
real supremacy of the house-father;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and he protests vigorously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
against the tendency, even on the part of Leist, to
confound old Indic with old Aryan law; for the "Indians of
the Vedas are in many respects more advanced than the
Germans a thousand or the Slavs two thousand years later."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Valuable as the criticism of Dargun undoubtedly is, notably
his distinction between power and relationship, it can
scarcely be admitted that he has done more than reopen the
question of the existence at any time of mother-right among
the Aryans. His results are negative. He has not shifted
the burden of proof; while his argument tends to confirm the
view of the philologists that from the primitive stage the
Aryan father was head of the household.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>But the patriarchal theory, strictly considered, fares little
better than the maternal at the hands of recent investigators.
Leist, who has been able with wonderful completeness
to reconstruct the juridical life of the early household,
though largely on the basis of old Indic sources, declares
positively that "the Aryan people has not within itself a
single element of patriarchalism."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> This statement, as
Bernhöft observes,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> is perhaps too sweeping, even when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
tested by the results of Leist's own researches; but the
patriarchal family of Sir Henry Maine does not appear.
The evolution of juridical conceptions among the old
Aryans, according to Leist, presents two general phases.
First is the <i>rita</i> stage, or period of fixed, divinely appointed
order, of natural law, corresponding to the Greek <i>cosmos</i> or
<i>phusis</i> and the Latin <i>ratum</i> or <i>ratio naturalis</i>. In this
"natural <em>history</em>" or pantheistic stage there is at first little
idea of law as something to be separately contemplated.
Under <i>rita</i> is comprehended the unchangeable order observable
in the material world as well as in the physical and
social life of man; but the universe and the creative energy,
the All and Varuna, are identified or blended in thought.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Only slowly are these concepts differentiated and the immutable
order of nature becomes looked upon as <i>dhama</i>, or a
holy ordinance established by Varuna, who now appears as a
protecting and creative spirit.</p>

<p><i>Dhama</i> thus forms a means of transition to the second
juridical phase, that of <i>dharma</i>, or divine law, corresponding
to the Greek <i>themis</i> and the Latin <i>fas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In the <i>dharma</i> period,
law is regarded as inspired by the gods, whose earthly agent,
the priest or hero-king, is intrusted with its application; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in it the rules governing civil and public conduct, according to
modern conceptions, are not distinguished from those relating
to manners, morality, or religion. When history dawns, our
early Aryan ancestors had already entered the <i>dharma</i> phase
of evolution; and even now the Hindus have scarcely gained
the third phase, prevailing in the civilized West, in which
the element of "civil law" is separate from all other ingredients.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Of the family relations of our primitive ancestors in the
<i>rita</i> period we know little, except through inference or
analogy. The so-called "natural forms" of marriage by
purchase and capture were doubtless practiced, but probably
not exclusively; and these customs were handed down to
the second period, though they were modified to bring them
into harmony with the higher ethical and social ideas which
had then gained predominance.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Whether or not the absolute
power of the father and the strict rule of agnation prevailed
it would be as difficult to affirm as to deny.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In the <i>dharma</i>
period the ancient <i>rita</i> conception of marriage as an ordinance
of nature, whose real purpose is to provide posterity,
is still retained; but it gains a social character.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The central
principle of the Aryan household is the Hestia-Vesta cult,
or the worship of the sacred hearth. To gain the protection
of the ancestral gods the hearth-fire must be kept always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
burning; and the care of the family <i>sacra</i> is the special
function of the house-father, who is lord and priest of the
family. But the house-mother holds a worthy position in
the domestic worship. From the first kindling of the hearth-fire
at the nuptials, she appears as co-priestess and helper of
her husband in the sacred rites. The whole life-partnership
of the wedded pair is shaped and dominated by lofty religious
motives. The Aryan housewife is not the chattel of her husband;
she is a free woman and shares in his highest sacred
functions. The primary purpose of the union is the birth
of a legitimate son to perpetuate the paternal line and to
foster the ancestral cult.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> So paramount is this motive that,
in case no son is born in wedlock, resort may be had to
adoption, or to analogous expedients for the fictitious extension
of fatherhood. For among the Aryans, as Maine
suggests, the fiction of adoption is of the highest legal
importance; and, indeed, very widely among the races of
mankind it has served a useful purpose in social progress.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Here also the Aryan wife appears as co-priestess with her
husband. Each is regarded as having a share in the begetting
of the child, and they unite in giving the son in adoption
to another household.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Accordingly the wife is not the
mere chattel of her husband, who owns the children by
virtue of his proprietorship in the mother.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The house-father
appears in the sacred books as lord of the wife, who
owes him reverence and obedience; yet she is not reduced
to patriarchal slavery. With the husband she exercises joint
control over the sons; and these are released entirely from
parental authority when they marry and establish new households.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The male line takes legal precedence; but the
maternal kindred are clearly recognized in a way wholly
inconsistent with strict agnation.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> According to the primitive
Indic conception the wife is regarded as incapable of
property. Neither the widow nor the daughters could
inherit, the estate passing to the sons as in theory a means
of providing for the <i>sacra</i> of the deceased house-father.
Still the bride possessed her personal belongings&mdash;her
couch, clothing, and ornaments; and from this germ gradually
arose, beginning even in remote antiquity, her existing
rights of property and inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In short, the old Aryan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
household reveals but the elements of agnation and the
<i>potestas</i> as they appear in the Roman law.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>This conclusion is confirmed by the customs of the Aryan
peoples after the separation. Among the Hellenes at the
first dawn of history the family appears as a member of the
<i>gens</i>, which is held together usually by the ties of blood-relationship.
The house-father is lord or monarch of the
family. But his authority is tempered in various ways.
Originally, as among the primitive Aryans, he may have
exercised the power of life and death over his children; but
in no case could he "put a child to death without the consent
of the collective ancestors," or near kindred.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> By the
Aryans the <i>jus vitae necisque</i> was never looked upon as an
arbitrary right of destruction, but merely as a means of
domestic discipline.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The Greek father might sell his minor
sons and unmarried daughters; but "it appears that, even
here, merely the labor of the youth and not the person itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was disposed of by sale," and the custom was controlled by
the usage of the <i>gens</i>.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The wife, as among the Hindus,
holds a dignified position in the household. She is her
husband's partner in the domestic economy and the sacred
rites. Equally with him she is "the cause of the son's
existence," and in consequence exercises over him conjointly
with the father the powers of sale and life and death.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Thus Hellenic custom preserves the essential element of the
Aryan paternal authority, which signifies a protecting, not
an arbitrary or ruthlessly destructive, power. Among the
historic Greeks the agnatic principle finds expression especially
in the right of guardianship, which is transmitted in
the paternal line. Such is the judgment of Leist, whose
masterly account of the development of the Aryan agnatic
conception proves that here as elsewhere the Roman and the
Greek stood upon common ground.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The point of divergence
is the lifelong continuance of the Roman <i>potestas</i>; whereas
in Hellas the son was emancipated at maturity.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Examination of the customs of the Celts,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the Slavonians,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and ancient Germans<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> leads to a like result. Accordingly
we are forced to admit the accuracy of Gaius's conclusion.
Writing in the time of the Antonines, he declares his
belief that the <i>patria potestas</i> is peculiarly a Roman institution.
Only among the Asiatic Galatæ had he observed a
similar authority exercised by the father over his children.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Instead of existing "almost everywhere," often preserving as
in a mold the imprint of the paternal power which it has
outlived and upon which it is thought always to depend,
among Aryan peoples agnation is found together with the
<i>potestas</i> only in one instance, that of the Roman law; and
even in this case it was virtually the first to expire.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> For,
as is well known to the student of Roman jurisprudence,
strict agnation, as determining right of succession, disappeared
under the influence of the edict and imperial statutes
long before the last vestige of the real <i>patria potestas</i> was
swept away by the legislation of Justinian.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, in addition to the historical difficulty, there
is another strong reason for doubting the dependence of agnation
upon <i>patria potestas</i>: the inconsistency of the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in its effects upon kinship. If the descendants of married
women are excluded from relationship, solely on the ground
that they belong to another <i>potestas</i>, why, for the same
reason, should not the children of men, say of brothers
<i>sui juris</i>,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> be likewise mutually excluded? Plainly some
more satisfactory explanation of this remarkable discrimination
between the sexes must exist. Such an explanation
McLennan finds in exogamy, or the custom which forbids
marriage between persons of the same group of acknowledged
kindred.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> It seems probable that in early times the
patrician family was coextensive with the <i>gens</i>. <i>Agnatio</i>
and <i>gentilitas</i> were equivalent expressions.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> During the
historical period, at any rate, <i>gentilitas</i> is traced through
the male line; and it is not impossible that originally inter-marriage
was forbidden between those bearing the same
gentile name.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In that case, agnation appears as the natural
result of the gentile rule of exogamy, retained, after the
weakening of the <i>gens</i>, for the regulation of succession
within the family. Exogamy, however, does not necessarily
imply the <i>patria potestas</i>, but is found more frequently
perhaps with the maternal than with the paternal system
of kinship.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In fact, for the Romans and kindred Italic
tribes, considerable evidence has been collected by various
writers pointing, as they believe, to an early transition from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the maternal to the cognatic or the agnatic system.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> While
this conclusion may be rejected, it must nevertheless be
admitted that criticism of the patriarchal theory has been
very successful in its general results. It appears to have
established beyond question the complex and highly artificial
character of the Roman family.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> So far from being the
type of early social organization, it is seen to be relatively
modern and ill fitted to the condition of primitive men.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the patriarchal theory has had to reckon
with a totally different view of the genesis and development
of social institutions. To this view let us now turn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

THEORY OF THE HORDE AND MOTHER-RIGHT</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note II.</span>&mdash;A pioneer in the comparative history
of marriage and the family is Unger, <cite>Die Ehe in ihrer welthistorischen
Entwicklung</cite> (Vienna, 1850), who notices many of the leading phenomena
connected with these institutions in different parts of the
world; but his book is essentially a <i>Tendenzschrift</i>, to prove the elevating
influence of Christianity and Teutonism. The literature of the
Horde and Mother-Right opens, however, with Bachofen's singular but
learned treatise, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Mutterrecht: Eine Untersuchung über die
Gynaikokratie der alten Welt nach ihrer religiösen und rechtlichen
Natur</i> (Stuttgart, 1861), of which the original edition is now exceedingly
scarce, although there is an exact reprint (Basel, 1897). This
work is supplemented by Bachofen's <cite>Die Sage von Tanaquil</cite> (Heidelberg,
1870), and his <cite>Antiquärische Briefe</cite> (Strassburg, 1886). Upon the
<i>Mutterrecht</i> was based Giraud-Teulon's <cite>La mère chez certains peuples
de l'antiquité</cite> (Paris and Leipzig, 1867); followed by <cite>Les origines de
la famille</cite> (Geneva, 1874), and <cite>Les origines du mariage et de la famille</cite>
(Geneva and Paris, 1884), in both of which Bachofen's principal conclusions
are supported with much new material. A thoroughgoing
disciple of the same school is Lippert, <cite>Die Geschichte der Familie</cite>
(Stuttgart, 1884); and <cite>Kulturgeschichte der Menschheit</cite> (Stuttgart,
1886-87). Very important also in this connection are the <cite>Mutterrecht
und Raubehe</cite> of Dargun (Breslau, 1883), and his later treatise, <cite>Mutterrecht
und Vaterrecht</cite> (Leipzig, 1892), a very able defense of the theory
of mother-right for the Aryan peoples after the separation, though conceding
that the maternal system was not developed in the primitive
stage.</p>

<p>A scholar, who in the main belongs to the same group and who is
one of the foremost students of the laws and usages of savage and barbarous
peoples, is Post, whose more important writings are <cite>Die

<p>By entirely different routes the theories of universal communism
and mother-right were reached by Lewis H. Morgan, beginning with
the <cite>League of the Iroquois</cite> (Rochester, 1851); followed by his great
work on <cite>Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity</cite> (Washington, 1871);
the systematic treatise entitled <cite>Ancient Society</cite> (New York, 1878); and
the <cite>Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines</cite> (Washington,
1881); and by J. F. McLennan, <cite>Primitive Marriage</cite> (1865); reprinted
with other papers as <cite>Studies in Ancient History</cite> (London, 1876). After
the author's death appeared the <cite>Patriarchal Theory</cite> (London, 1885),
edited and completed by his brother Donald McLennan; and the second
series of <cite>Studies</cite> (London and New York, 1896), edited by his widow and
Arthur Platt.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock, <cite>Origin of Civilization</cite> (New York, 1889), maintains
the theory and introduces the name of "communal marriage."
McLennan is in the main supported by Robertson Smith, <cite>Kinship and

<p>McLennan was first systematically and luminously criticised by
Spencer, in Part III of his <cite>Principles of Sociology</cite> (published, in parts,
1874-77; complete, New York, 1879). McLennan replied in two articles
in the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite>, XXVII (London, 1877); and in turn Spencer
has a "Rejoinder," reprinted in his <cite>Various Fragments</cite> (New York,

<h3>I. BACHOFEN AND HIS DISCIPLES</h3>

<p>In the same year with the <cite>Ancient Law</cite> appeared a book
which was destined to have an extraordinary influence in
giving a new direction to speculation and research. This
was the <cite>Mutterrecht</cite> of the Swiss scholar Johann Jacob
Bachofen, whose memory is revered by many followers.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
The author shows a wide and minute acquaintance with
classic literature and the early myths; but his work is fantastic
and almost wholly devoid of scientific method.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The
material is drawn mainly from two sources: the fragmentary
notices of the rules of kinship and the matrimonial customs
of various peoples handed down from ancient writers, supplemented
slightly through similar accounts by modern
travelers; and an interpretation of the supposed symbolism
of religious myths, particularly those of the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The
inferences derived from this second source are often far-fetched
and fanciful in the extreme. Though the general
results of the investigation are summarized in a short introduction,
the argument is so loose, the arrangement so confusing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and the style so obscure that it is with the utmost
difficulty the author's meaning can be gathered. Nevertheless
it is undeniable that he has created the terminology and
developed the essential elements of the communistic and
gynocratic theories even in their leading details.</p>

<p>According to Bachofen, there are three general phases
in the evolution of human sexual relations. The first is the
period of aphrodistic hetairism, in which men and women
have each other in common; the second is the period of
demetrian mother-right or gynocracy, in which kinship and
succession are in the maternal line and woman gains religious
and political supremacy; and the third, the period of the
patriarchate or apollonistic father-right, in which the more
spiritual principle of paternity is triumphant.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Each of these
periods is regarded as a universal culture-stage.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>In the first phase, or that of the unregulated communism,
material motherhood is the essential fact. Fatherhood is
necessarily uncertain. There is no conception of kinship
between father and child. Woman, it is assumed, is exposed
to the lust or sexual tyranny of man; and it is through her
successful revolt against the bondage of unbridled hetairism
that she attains the second stage of progress.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The period
of demetrian gynocracy is therefore represented as a turning-point,
a transitional phase, through which humanity passes
from its lowest to its highest status. With it the rudiments
of marriage appear, but combined with hetairism surviving
in various forms or gradations. It is the woman and not
the man who obeys the marriage law.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Indeed, strict marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the exclusive appropriation of a woman by one man,
is looked upon as an abridgment of a natural or religious
right for which expiation must be rendered to the goddess
whose law is violated;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and only thus, as a penalty or composition
for the privilege of restricted intercourse, can be
rationally explained those lascivious customs, such as temporary
prostitution, so often found in connection with legal
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>A difficulty, however, presents itself. The theory of
Bachofen assumes, as a general fact in social evolution, that
a period of promiscuity and oppression of the female sex is
followed, not merely by an age of mother-right, involving as
a necessary consequence of the continued uncertainty of
fatherhood the recognition of kinship only in the maternal
line; but by an age of gynocracy, involving the social leadership
of women and eventually the political and even the
military subordination of men. Woman emancipates herself
and then she becomes an Amazon. "Weary of the lust
of man, she first feels a longing for a securer position and a
purer existence. The feeling of shame and the rage of
despair inflame her to armed resistance."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> As "a rival to
man, the Amazon became hostile to him, and began to
withdraw from marriage and from motherhood. This set
limits to the rule of women, and provoked the punishment
of heaven and men. Thus Jason put an end to the rule of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the Amazons in Lemnos; thus Dionysos and Bellerophon
strove together, passionately, yet without obtaining any
decisive victory, until Apollo with calm superiority finally
became the conqueror;"<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and so the purer principle of
fatherhood prevailed and the era of father-right appeared.
But, says Bachofen, that woman should gain supremacy
over man arouses our astonishment, because the fact is contrary
to what we should expect from their relative physical
powers. "The law of nature delivers the scepter of power to
the stronger." The paradox, however, is easily explained.
"At all times woman has exerted the most powerful influence
upon man, upon the culture and morals (<i>Gesellung</i>) of
peoples," through the direction of her mind toward the
supernatural, the wonderful, and the divine. Through her
possession of the mysteries of religion she deprived man
of the superior position which nature had given him.
"Religion is the only efficient lever of all civilization. Each
elevation and depression of human life has its origin in a
movement which begins in this supreme department."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
"Just as the child receives its first discipline from the
mother, so do peoples receive it from woman. The man
must serve before he can attain supremacy. To the wife
alone it is given to tame the unbridled power of man and to
guide him in the path of well-doing."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> But amazonism was
a shock to the religious feeling in the stage of mother-right,
just as gross hetairism was an offense in the former period.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Hence arose a striving for the realization of a higher conception
of social relations. "It was the assertion of fatherhood
which delivered the mind from natural appearances,
and when this was successfully achieved, human existence
was raised above the laws of material life. The principle of
motherhood is common to all the species of animal life, but
man goes beyond this tie in giving the pre-eminence to the
power of procreation, and thus becomes conscious of his
higher vocation.... In the paternal and spiritual principle
he breaks through the bonds of tellurism and looks
upward to the higher regions of the cosmos. Victorious
fatherhood thus becomes as distinctly connected with the
heavenly light as prolific motherhood is with the teeming
earth."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> "All the stages of sexual life, from aphrodistic
hetairism to the apollonistic purity of fatherhood, have their
corresponding type in the stages of natural life, from the
wild vegetation of the morass, the prototype of conjugal
motherhood, to the harmonic law of the Uranian world, to
the heavenly light which, as the <i>flamma non urens</i>, corresponds
to the eternal youth of fatherhood. The connection
is so completely in accordance with law, that the form taken
by the sexual relations of life may be inferred from the predominance
of one or the other of these universal substances
in worship."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The theories of Bachofen have given rise to luxurious
speculation. With slight modification his conclusions have
been accepted by a host of faithful disciples. By others
they have been criticised or abandoned. Various schemes
have been constructed in the attempt to explain the sequence
in which the forms of marriage and the phases of the family
have historically appeared. With the literature of this
speculation, so far as primitive communism is assumed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
present chapter is concerned. As a rule, only the incidental
or negative results of criticism will be noticed, leaving for
the following two chapters the criticism originating in a
wholly different view of social evolution.</p>

<p>It is convenient in the outset to note the importance of
carefully distinguishing between the conception of mother-right,
implying kinship in the female line, and that of
gynocracy, denoting the supremacy of the female sex.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Bachofen, as already seen, uses <i>Mutterrecht</i> as comprehending
gynocracy; while some of his followers likewise
speak confidently of a time when women took social precedence
of men, or even held them in political subjection.
Such is the view of Giraud-Teulon, who, with Bachofen,
interprets the Amazon myth as implying an age in which
women exercised a decided social and political domination.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Lippert and Unger take a similar position.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> On the other
hand, it is maintained by a number of writers, who reject
the idea of a political or military gynocracy, that the inheritance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of name and family rights through the mother usually
gives woman a decided precedence in the sphere of social
life and private law. This is the opinion of Kautsky, who
declares that mother-right involves the headship of woman
in the family.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Peschel,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Tylor,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Letourneau,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and Hellwald<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
hold a similar view; and with them Grosse,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Kohler,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and
Friedrichs,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> though more reserved, appear in the main to
coincide. Dargun likewise rejects the idea of woman's
political supremacy, while holding that mother-right sometimes
grows into a real matriarchate so far as private law
is concerned.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The weight of evidence, however, shows that
even this modified view exaggerates the advantages gained
by woman under mother-right. It may be admitted that
here and there&mdash;as for instance among the Sioux, the Wyandots,
and some other American peoples<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>&mdash;the determination
of the child's social and legal rights through the mother
has somewhat ameliorated the condition of woman. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
often, as Dargun<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> has so well shown, the same custom has
not enabled her to escape social degradation or marital
bondage.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> She is rather the medium through which rights
are conveyed and relations established. "Thus, for instance,
among the Australians, with whom the clan of the children
is, as a rule, determined by that of the mother, the husband
is, to quote Mr. Curr, almost an autocrat in his family, and
the children always belong to his tribe."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Dr. Starcke
reaches a similar conclusion. Referring to the "important
place" taken by the wife among various African peoples, he
declares that all which "has been said only shows that
women in some instances enjoy privileges which are always
enjoyed by men."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In short, if among many peoples at
some stage of progress research has clearly demonstrated
the existence of mother-right, it has just as clearly shown
that the notion of a gynocracy, of a period of female
supremacy, is without historical foundation.</p>

<p>The theory of original communism has been accepted by
many writers,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> though examples of absolute promiscuity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
have not been produced.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Its former existence is inferred
from certain customs and institutions which are believed to
be its survivals. Even the promiscuity which is thus
assumed is not "perfectly indiscriminate," but restricted to
the members of the unorganized horde or tribe occupying
a particular locality or roaming about together. Hence,
significantly, it has sometimes been described as communal
or group "marriage."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Accordingly the horde<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> or
band becomes the unit or starting-point of social development.</p>

<p>Many evidences of the former universality of promiscuity
are brought forward. This evidence&mdash;to adopt Westermarck's
convenient analysis&mdash;"flows from two sources.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
First, there are, in the books of ancient writers and modern
travelers, notices of some savage nations said to live promiscuously;
secondly, there are some remarkable customs which
are assumed to be social survivals, pointing to an earlier stage
of civilization when marriage did not exist."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The mass of
facts collected to illustrate the licentiousness of savage and
barbarous tribes cannot here be dwelt upon.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> It must suffice
for the present to note that, according to recent investigation,
every instance of alleged indiscriminate sexual relations
appears to stop far short of absolute promiscuity.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> So also
several of the more interesting customs, regarded as direct
survivals of communism, require only to be briefly mentioned.
The principal argument, of course, as will presently appear,
is grounded upon the existence of polyandry, and especially
upon the proofs adduced of the wide prevalence of kinship
reckoned through the mother's line. For it is generally
assumed that this system can arise only when paternity is
uncertain. Legalized hetairism or prostitution,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> practiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
under various forms and restrictions among many peoples,
savage, barbarous, and civilized, is thought to be a proof
of original communism.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The same is true of "proof-marriages,"<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
existing among the Wotjäken, Burmese, the
Germans, in Loango, and elsewhere; of "temporary" marriages,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
as among the Parthians and American Indians; and
of "wife-lending," examples of which are afforded by the
Spartans, Romans, Hindus, Arabs, Eskimo, Germans, Wotjäken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and many other peoples.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> In this connection, likewise,
belong those "scandalous nuptial rites" which Bachofen,
Lubbock, and Giraud-Teulon regard as acts of "expiation"
for marriage. According to this theory, marriage, the individual
possession of a woman, was originally regarded as a
violation of communal right, for which some compensation
or expiation must be rendered.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The customs referred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
fall for the most part in two general classes. The first
group comprises the lascivious religious rites, the so-called
sacred or temple prostitution, found in connection with
the worship of various deities of love and procreation, such
as the Babylonian Mylitta, the Hellenic Aphrodite, the
Italian Venus and the Carthaginian Moloch.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> In the second
class fall the revolting nuptial privileges, accorded in
many parts of the world to priest, chieftain, or king, or
to the friends of the bridegroom and sometimes to those
of the bride. To these privileges in general the name of
<i>jus primae noctis</i> has been given.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> A curious example of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
this practice among the American aborigines is communicated
by Castañeda.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The argument for original promiscuity based on the
various practices just mentioned is not conclusive. Most, if
not all, of them are perhaps capable of other and simpler
explanations. The wife-lending, as suggested by Westermarck,
may be "due merely to savage ideas of hospitality;"<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
while the custom of sacred prostitution evidently belongs
"to phallic-worship, and occurred, as Mr. McLennan justly
remarks, among peoples who had advanced far beyond the
primitive state. The farther back we go, the less we find of
such customs in India; 'the germ only of phallic-worship
shows itself in the Vedas, and the gross luxuriance of licentiousness,
of which the cases referred to are examples, is of
later growth.'"<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> So likewise the <i>jus primae noctis</i>, instead of
being an expiation for an encroachment on communal right,
may be more naturally explained either as an abuse of power,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
in some cases as an evidence of hospitality,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> or in others as a
"common war-right, exercised whenever, under any circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
capture of a woman is made by a war-party."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The
toleration of the custom, like that of wife-lending, may sometimes
be due to the "juridical" nature of fatherhood as
conceived by primitive men.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the theory that these customs are
evidences of original sexual communism has gained support
from the recent researches of Spencer and Gillen in their
very able and detailed book on the <cite>Native Tribes of Central
Australia</cite>. Among these aborigines, the authors declare,
"so far as marital relations ... are concerned, we find
that whilst there is individual marriage, there are, in actual
practice, occasions on which the relations are of a much
wider nature. We have, indeed, in this respect three very
distinct series of relationships." First we find the present
"normal condition of individual marriage with the occasional
existence of marital relations between the individual wife and
other men of the same group as that to which her husband
belongs, and the occasional existence also of still wider marital
relations;" secondly "we have evidence of the existence
at a prior time of actual group marriage;" and in the third
place "we have evidence of the existence at a still earlier
time of still wider marital relations."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>But these usages are capable of a very different explanation.
That they imply a primitive state of promiscuity is
emphatically denied by Crawley. Like sacred prostitution,
the customs of avoidance, the couvade, and marriage rites
in general, according to his theory, they take their rise in
the religious or superstitious ideas upon which sexual taboo
rests.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Adherents of the communistic theory are not entirely at
one as to the phases in the development of marriage and the
family. Very generally the family, regarded from the standpoint
of authority and kinship, is said to pass from the unregulated
horde through the maternal and the paternal to the
parental or two-sided stage.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Thus Dargun declares that
there is a tendency for the uterine system of kinship to give
place to the paternal, but never the reverse.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Kohler takes
the same position.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Lippert regards the history of social
culture as beginning with the natural relation of mother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
child, producing in course of evolution, long before "marriage"
arose, the "primitive family" whose principle is
mother-right, and which, in turn, under various influences,
generally yields to the "old family" (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altfamilie</i>) in its
origin based, not on relationship, but on patriarchal power
and possession.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Bernhöft denies the invariable sequence of
mother-right and father-right;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and Kautsky maintains that
the two systems are parallel, not successive, developments
from the hetairism of the primitive horde.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Marriage also, like the family, is said to pass through
several distinct phases of development. Thus, with respect
to the number of persons joining in a household, Friedrichs
distinguishes four "forms" of marriage which, with equal
propriety, may be called forms of the family. These are
group-marriage, polyandry, polygyny, and monogamy, the
first three forms having several varieties.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> But, as will
hereafter appear,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> it would be rash to infer that these forms
necessarily arise in the order named. Again, with regard
to the way in which it originates, marriage presents a number
of successive stages. According to Kohler,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> these are
marriage by capture, marriage by purchase, religious marriage,
and civil marriage. That wife-capture generally
gives place to wife-purchase, and this in turn to marriage
by gift, and then to the modern contract between the parents,
or later between the parties themselves, is especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
insisted upon. Hildebrand,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> however, reverses this order.
A measure of progress he finds in what he regards as the
three great industrial stages of human culture: those of the
chase, pastoral life, and agriculture. In the first stage, not
communism, but a tendency toward monogamy prevails.
There is little notion of private property; hence covetousness
is not a motive of social action. Marriages are freely
formed through presents given to the parents, or even without
them by simple agreement of the parties. Later, with
the rise of private property, marriage by purchase and marriage
by capture come into existence; though capture is
always exceptional and of comparatively little importance in
the history of marriage.</p>

<p>Similar to the view of Hildebrand, in respect to the initial
stage, is the theory of Kautsky.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The starting-point is the
horde. In this absolute equality of the sexes prevails; and
the only divisions are the different generations. Neither
the maternal nor the paternal line is recognized, for the
children belong to the group. Not promiscuity, but
"hetairism,"<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> or rather "hetairistic monogamy," exists.
Incessant feuds, however, lead to wife-capture; and wife-capture
tends directly to communism, for the captured
woman belongs as a slave to the band. But the rights of
the band may pass to the individual. The free native
woman is "wooed;" the war-captive is "fought-for;" and so
she becomes the slave-wife of the strongest, who may win
other wives in the same way. Marriage by capture thus
conquers the original monogamy, in whose place polygyny
appears, either at once, or after a transition-period of community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in women. Moreover, in this process may be discerned
the genesis of modern individual marriage under the
sanction of the law. But the consequences of wife-capture
are not yet exhausted. The presence in the horde of women
taken from several neighboring bands leads at once to the
formation of clans and to the matriarchate; for the connection
of children with the clan is naturally determined by
the mother. The development of private property produces
still further results. The individual may buy his wife.
She becomes his chattel; and the offspring also belong to
him. Thus marriage by purchase gains the victory over
wife-capture; and the patriarchate triumphs over mother-right.
This is the order of development in the more
war-like hordes. But wife-capture does not always precede
wife-purchase as a general phase. In the more peaceful and
industrious groups wife-capture does not appear at all.
Here hetairistic monogamy runs its natural course. Partly
under the external influence of tribes where mother-right
existed as the result of wife-capture, but mainly under the
powerful influence of private property, the matriarchate arose.
In the earlier stage kinship with the father was disregarded
or unknown. Naturally, therefore, under the new condition,
name and also property were transmitted to the children
through the mother, with whom their physical connection
was always manifest. So it appears that the conception of
private property is the basis of "hetairistic mother-right"
as it is of father-right; and hetairistic mother-right, as
distinguished from the mother-right which owes its origin
to wife-capture, implies the precedence of woman in the
family.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> "Gynocracy and patriarchalism are therefore
parallel branches of the same stem," the original hetairism
of the horde: the one cannot be a further development of
the other. Gynocracy, and with it polyandry, which is its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
result,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> is the highest stage in the evolution of hetairistic
mother-right; just as polygyny and the patriarchal family
are the highest stage in the evolution of father-right or the
agnatic system of kinship.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>To the theory of Kautsky that of Dargun, already explained,
bears some resemblance in important details. But
Dargun rejects Kautsky's idea of original monogamy; and
he does not regard wife-purchase as the necessary source of
the patriarchate, though the rise of the latter was greatly
favored by it; while mother-right is especially due to the
uncertainty of fatherhood.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Hellwald&mdash;who in the general development of his subject
and in many essential particulars agrees closely with
Lippert<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>&mdash;seeks the elements of human sexual relations in
those of the lower animals. Absolute promiscuity has never
existed among men. The hetairism which prevailed was
restricted to the immediate band or horde of kindred, which
was probably never large. Thus in the horde there was
"unregulated polygyny." To the earliest sexual relations<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
of men neither "marriage" nor "family" may properly
be applied; and for them no suitable name is forthcoming.
In the horde the first social institution evolved was the
"mother-group" or rudimentary primitive family (<i>Urfamilie</i>).
"Mother and child," as Lippert suggests, "these were
the simplest elements of the oldest organization." For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
"relation of mother and child alone is given by nature."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
In the form of the mother-group the family, however imperfectly
constituted, precedes the state in the order of growth;
although it is not until society, the state, has gained permanent
form that from it the historical "family" is developed.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
Indeed, the mother-group is "lacking in everything"
which distinguishes the family according to our modern
conceptions.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The history of the "primitive family," so far
as mother-right is concerned, shows two stages of evolution.
The first stage is that of the mother-group strictly so called,
through which, as Bachofen and Dargun declare, every race
passes and in which all relationship is traced through the
mother's blood.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Absolute unity or identity of blood is
the basis of the earliest human conception of relationship.
Generations or stages of seniority alone (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altersstufen</i>),
not degrees of kinship, are recognized. Members of the
group are of equal blood, "consanguine."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Relationship
with the father is as yet unknown; and there is in the outset
no conception of property. Gradually, however, in the
endogamous mother-group a horror of incest, of inbreeding,
arises, thus leading to exogamy, which is often facilitated
by the stealing of women from surrounding groups. The
obtaining of foreign women next produces the clan system.
Private property in land and movables arises, especially
among those peoples which have attained to settled life and
a knowledge of agriculture. In this way the "primitive
family" enters upon its second stage&mdash;that of the matriarchate.
Here we find for the first time forms of marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and the family properly so called, although rudimentary as
compared with the modern institutions. The mother ceases
to be merely the center of the common life; she is now the
social axis around which everything revolves. Mother-right,
implying kinship as well as succession to name and property
exclusively in the maternal line, becomes fully established.
The matriarchate, unlike the simple mother-group,
is not a universal phase through which all mankind has run.
In some cases the agnatic system or father-right may have
followed immediately upon the earlier stage of mother-right.
Incident to the matriarchate are the polygynous and polyandrous
forms of the family. With these the institution of
property grew apace; and so we reach the paternal system,
whose triumph is powerfully aided by wife-capture. In
this stage, whatever be the form of social union&mdash;whether it
be called <i>gens</i>, <i>sippe</i>, or joint-family&mdash;it rests upon the
authority of the father or patriarchal lord. Following Lippert,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
the author prefers for this patriarchal group the name
"old family" (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altfamilie</i>); and he finds its most famous
examples in Hellas and Rome. Here monogamy gained the
victory; and so, under the influence mainly of Stoicism and
Christianity, the foundations of modern marriage and the
individual family were laid.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The influence of economic forces on the evolution of
matrimonial and family institutions is especially emphasized
by Grosse. Restricting his examination to the conditions
which lie within actual "historical or ethnological experience,"
he seeks to demonstrate that the "various forms of
the family correspond to the various forms of economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wirthschaft</i>);" that "in its essential features the character
of each particular form of the family may be explained by
the form of economy in which it is rooted." For the sake
of clearer analysis the peoples known to history or ethnology
are arranged, not in three, but in five groups according to
the leading types of industrial life. These are the lower
and upper hunters, the pastoral peoples, and the lower and
upper cultivators of the soil.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> But, like Kohler, Lippert,
and Hellwald,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> the author rejects the popular theory adhered
to by Hildebrand, that the chase, herding, and agriculture
are three successive stages of progress through which all the
races of mankind have necessarily passed. For, as a matter
of fact, some pastoral peoples, and even some hunters, like
the Eskimo, are more advanced in culture than various
peoples who are chiefly dependent upon agriculture; and
some tillers of the soil, as Hildebrand concedes, may never
have passed through the pastoral stage.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> On the other
hand, Grosse distinguishes two forms of the family: the
individual family (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sonderfamilie</i>), or the community of
parents and children living in a lasting and exclusive marriage
relation, and the great-family (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grossfamilie</i>), which
comprises, not merely parents and children, but all descendants
with their families, so far as they are not separated
from it by marriage or otherwise. Examples of the "great-family"
are afforded by the Romans and the Chinese; while
the "individual family" is practically the only form known
wherever western European culture prevails. In each form
of the family either the maternal or the paternal succession
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mutterfolge</i> or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vaterfolge</i>) may exist; but succession must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
not be confused with the matriarchate or with the patriarchate,
each involving the idea of authority; although paternal
succession usually implies paternal power, while succession
in the female line does not necessarily carry with it the
supremacy of the mother.</p>

<p>Among the peoples classed as "lower hunters," even the
most backward, exists the individual family; and in the
majority of cases it is founded on monogamic marriage, for
promiscuity nowhere appears. The authority of the husband
is patriarchal. "He procures his wife by exchange or service;
and in consequence he is her owner and lord." The "great-family"
and the <i>gens</i> (<i>sippe</i>) are also found among these
peoples; but they are relatively little developed. <i>Gentes</i>
which have become unions for protection and control of territory
are father-<i>gentes</i>; while those in which the kinship is
traced through the mother are not unions for the purposes of
the common life, but for maintenance of the common name.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
The case is practically the same for the "upper hunters."
Wife-purchase, however, is more pronounced. The individual
monogamic family still predominates. Kinship through
the mother is not so much a "motive for union as it is
for separation of those related by blood."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Here as among
the lower hunters it is the paternal <i>gens</i> which forms an
actual union for the common life; and there is "not the least
ground for assuming" that a patriarchal gentile constitution
has replaced an earlier matriarchal form. Among peoples
leading a pastoral life, even more than with those devoted to
the chase, the chief economic production lies in the hands
of the man. Accordingly he has the place of power and
honor. Through him descent and kinship are usually traced.
Nowhere is the paternal system so one-sided and so stringently
carried out as among pastoral tribes. Woman is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
oppressed and degraded. She is bought or stolen by her
lord. Polygyny, with all its attendant evils, flourishes. The
individual family has a thoroughly patriarchal stamp; but it
is still the most conspicuous social fact, surpassing in practical
significance for the needs of the pastoral life the great-family,
and far more the <i>gens</i>. On the contrary, among the
lower cultivators woman holds an economic position at least
equal in social importance to that of man. As a rule, therefore,
she is no longer his slave, but his companion, sometimes
even his superior. She gains a corresponding share in the
control of the children. The great-family is in like manner
affected by the new economic conditions. Communal agriculture
gives a mighty impulse to the growth of the gentile
constitution; and now among many peoples, under influence
of the new and higher position of woman, the maternal <i>gens</i>,
perhaps existing side by side with the paternal <i>gens</i>, is
developed into a firm social, economic, and political union.
In the life of the lower cultivators, if the <i>gens</i> thus becomes
the mightiest social organization, the fact is due essentially
to its economic function. With the change from communal
to individual agriculture the gentile constitution is dissolved;
and so among the higher cultivators the individual monogamic
family has more than regained its former sway. "Thus
it appears," the author summarizes, "that under every form
of culture that form of family organization prevails which is
best suited to economic needs and conditions;" although, he
wisely warns us, a perfect explanation of the various types
of the human family can never be given until every part and
function of culture which has had an influence upon the
functions or the organisms of the family has been separately
examined for each case.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The views of Dargun, Hildebrand, and Grosse may be
compared with the remarkable, but scarcely well-grounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
speculation of Mucke.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> According to his ingenious theory,
men originally lived in the horde, which, so far from being
a fortuitous unorganized band, in which "animal promiscuity"
prevailed, was so strictly ordered as to be worthy the
name of the "society of the primeval age."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> In the horde all
are free and equal. There is no subordination of the wife,
monogamy prevails; for, since every male or female has his
predestined mate, there is no room for communism. The
author's treatise rests upon the fundamental assumption that
primitive relationships are merely "space-relationships."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
They do not arise in notions of descent. They are determined
by the fixed spaces occupied by each sex, generation,
and individual in the <i>Hordenlager</i> or camping-place.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Every
male finds his predestined wife in the corresponding room or
division on the opposite side of the sleeping-space; each
brother thus marrying the sister nearest to himself in the
order of birth. This ideal life of the horde is brought to an
end through the rise of the family. The family (from <i>famel</i>,
a "servant") is the very opposite of the horde of free and
equal members, originating as it does in subjection and
servitude. Almost simultaneously the family develops two
forms, the androcratic and the gynocratic. Each originates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in capture<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> which, under the influence of the conception of
private property, yields to purchase. In the androcratic
family, the woman becomes a slave-wife; in the gynocratic,
the man becomes a slave-husband.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Polyandry is the natural
product of the gynocratic, as is polygyny of the androcratic
family. Originally each of these forms of the family is part
"maternal" and part "paternal," in the ordinary sense. But
gradually, under the influence of adoption, aided by purchase,
the horde is broken up and modern forms of the
family arise.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>


<h3>II. MORGAN'S CONSTRUCTIVE THEORY</h3>

<p>The doctrine of the primitive horde as the starting-point
of social evolution has a special interest in connection with
the researches of Lewis H. Morgan and J. F. McLennan.
Though their principal works appeared subsequently to that
of Bachofen,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> each has reached his conclusions independently;
and each, rejecting the patriarchal family as the
primordial unit, has set forth what may be called a "constructive"
theory of uniform social progress. In the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of each marriage and the family are made to pass through
an ascending series of phases for all mankind. Unquestionably
valuable as are their contributions to the material of
sociological science, seldom have there been seen more
striking examples of hasty generalization than appear in
the theoretical parts of their work.</p>

<p>This is particularly true of the theories of Morgan;<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
although in his <cite>Systems of Consanguinity</cite> he has with prodigious
labor erected a monument of scientific research
whose vast importance for the early history of human social
relations is by no means yet definitively settled; and whose
<cite>Ancient Society</cite>, aside from its speculative features, has the
distinction of first clearly identifying the gentile organization
of the Greeks and Romans with that of the red race of
the western continents. Starting with the organization of
society "on the basis of sex," as illustrated by the so-called
class or group-marriages of the Australian Kamilaroi, he
proceeds to discuss at length the gentile systems of the
American Indians and the classic nations.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Originally relationship
is traced in the female line, and intermarriage is
prohibited within the <i>gens</i>. The <i>gens</i> is older than the
monogamic family. It cannot have the family as its constituent
unit, because it is composed, not of entire families,
but of parts of families.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>The earliest phase of sexual relations among primitive
men is promiscuity. Following this are five successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
stages or forms of marriage and the family, shading into
each other, and each running a "long course in the tribes
of mankind, with a period of infancy, of maturity, and of
decadence."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Of these forms the first, second, and fifth are
"radical," that is, each developing a distinct system of consanguinity.
These systems of consanguinity "resolve themselves
into two ultimate forms, fundamentally distinct."
One is the <em>classificatory</em> and the other the <em>descriptive</em>.
"Under the first, consanguinei are never described, but are
classified into categories, irrespective of their nearness or
remoteness in degree to <i>Ego</i>; and the same term of relationship
is applied to all the persons in the same category."
Under the second, which came in with monogamy and prevails
among the Aryan, Semitic, and Uralian peoples, "consanguinei
are described either by the primary terms of
relationship or a combination of these terms, thus making
the relationship of each person specific."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The classificatory
systems of consanguinity, it should be carefully noted, are
more tenacious than the forms of marriage, their nomenclatures
often surviving long after the actual relationships
they denote have ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The first form of the family in Morgan's series is the
consanguine,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> based on the intermarriage of brothers and
sisters, own and collateral, in a group. Though now extinct,
this form is thought once to have been universal, rude survivals
being found even in the present century among the
Hawaiians. But the evidence of its former existence upon
which Mr. Morgan relies as conclusive is the Malayan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
system of consanguinity, which he assumes could only have
been produced by it. This system is found among the
Maoris, the Hawaiians, and other Polynesians. Anciently
it may have prevailed generally in Asia; and it lies at the
basis of the Chinese relationships. The Malayan system is
classificatory. "The only blood-relationships are the primary,"
being comprised in five categories. These are parent,
child, grandparent, grandchild, brother and sister. Thus
consanguine marriage "found mankind at the bottom of the
scale" of social progress.</p>

<p>In course of time, however, its evils were perceived
and the second form of the family arose. This is the
Punaluan,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> resting on the intermarriage of several sisters
in a group with each other's husbands; or on that of several
brothers in a group with each other's wives; marriage
between brothers and sisters not being permitted.
"The Punaluan family has existed in Europe, Asia, and
America<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> within the historical period, and in Polynesia
within the present century," the most interesting example
being afforded by the Hawaiians. It is an outgrowth of the
consanguine family "through the gradual exclusion of own
brothers and sisters from the marriage relation."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> With
it arose the organization into <i>gentes</i>, whose "fundamental
rules" in the archaic form are exogamy and relationship
in the female line. The Punaluan family co-operating
with the gentile organization,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> produced the Turanian or
Ganowánian system of consanguinity, which is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
classificatory.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> This is described by Morgan as "simply stupendous,"
recognizing "all the relationships known under the
Aryan system, besides an additional number unnoticed by
the latter."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>But forces were now operating within the Punaluan
family which were destined to transform it. "From the
necessities of the social state," there was more or less pairing
from the first, "each man having a principal wife
among a number of wives, and each woman a principal
husband among a number of husbands." Moreover, the
fuller development of the gentile organism, with its rule of
exogamy, tended to foster a sentiment hostile to the intermarriage
of near kindred and, in other ways, to produce a
scarcity of women available for marriage within the Punaluan
groups, thus leading to wife-capture and wife-purchase.
Under these influences arose the Syndiasmian, or third
general type of the family, based upon the marriage of
single pairs, often temporary and without exclusive cohabitation.
It is found among the Senaca-Iroquois and many
other American tribes, among the Tamils of South India,
and some other races of Asia.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> This family did not produce
a distinct system of consanguinity, the peoples having it
still retaining the Turanian system.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The next, or Patriarchal,
family, like the Syndiasmian, is "intermediate," not
being "sufficiently influential upon human affairs to create
a new, or modify essentially the then existing system of
consanguinity."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> It is found particularly among the Semites
and Romans, and is characterized by the "organization of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
number of persons, bond and free, into a family under
paternal power, for the purpose of holding lands, and for the
care of flocks and herds." The Syndiasmian, and in a less
degree the Patriarchal, constitute the transitional stage in
the development of the Monogamic family. Its rise was
especially fostered by the influence of property and the
increase of the paternal power, leading to the change from
the female to the male line of descent. It produced the
system of consanguinity prevailing among the Uralian,
Semitic, and Aryan peoples.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Such, sketched in hasty outline, is the symmetrical structure
which the author of the <cite>Ancient Society</cite> has erected.
But it has not been able wholly to withstand the shock of
adverse criticism. The argument rests on too narrow a
basis of investigation, and it is sometimes contradictory in
its details. Its real foundation is the assumption that the
nomenclatures of the classificatory systems of relationship
must necessarily denote actual relationships. The truth of
this assumption, however, is not self-evident. Other explanations
of their meaning, some of them simpler and far more
probable, have been offered. In the first place, it is evident
that Morgan was misled by Fison's account of the Kamilaroi
class-marriages.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Only in Australia was he able to find in
existence, as he believed, a social organization upon the basis
of sex. Yet it is by no means established that communal or
even group-marriage has ever prevailed among the Australian
aborigines. The criticism of Mr. Curr has raised doubt as
to the trustworthiness of Fison's theory, although it may
not have entirely shattered it.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> According to Curr, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
class-system is an ingenious arrangement to prevent close
intermarriages. Even first cousins may not marry.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The
Australian is very jealous of his wife, who may be betrothed
to him in childhood. Wife-lending occurs, but it is not
sanctioned by custom. The use of a single word for different
relationships, as for father and father's brother, is not an
evidence of former group-marriage, but of "poverty of
language."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Nevertheless the Australian nomenclature is
richer in terms of relationship than has been assumed by
Mr. Fison. "There is hardly an Australian vocabulary in
print" in which distinct translation of terms for "uncle,
aunt, nephew, niece, sister-in-law, and son-in-law" do not
occur.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Mucke, as we have already seen, explains the classificatory
system as being a survival of the primitive "space-relationships"
of the primitive horde.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> By Kautsky also its origin
is traced to the horde in which "hetairistic monogamy"
prevailed, and in which blood-relationship with the parents
was not regarded. The classes, therefore, have nothing to
do with descent, but each embraces all the individuals of a
single generation under a common name.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, McLennan, in his well-known controversy
with Morgan,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> insists that the system of nomenclature
is merely a "system of mutual salutations," urging the
fact that most of the peoples having it possess also "some
well-defined system of blood-ties."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Yet he believes that the
Malayan nomenclature, which lies at the basis of Morgan's
classificatory system, "had its origin in some early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
marriage-law."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Starcke criticises this inconsistency,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and comes to
the conclusion, after examination of the whole question, that
the "nomenclature was in every respect the faithful reflection
of the juridical relations which arose between the nearest
kinsfolk of each tribe. Individuals who were, according
to the legal point of view, on the same level with the speaker,
received the same designation."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> In substantial harmony
with this opinion are the results of Westermarck's researches.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
According to his view the classificatory nomenclatures are
merely terms of address, used to denote the sex, relative age,
or the "external, or social relationship in which the speaker
stands to the person whom he addresses."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>These criticisms have not gone unchallenged. More recent
and more detailed examination of the classificatory nomenclatures
has thrown new light on their meaning; although
their origin in promiscuity or "group-marriage" has not
been conclusively established. Thus Cunow, who in general
accepts the former existence of group-marriage among various
peoples, and even finds traces of it in Australia,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> denies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that the Australian class-nomenclatures are derived from
original group-relations;<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> nor are they, as Westermarck
believes, ever employed as mere empty terms of polite or
respectful address.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The class-systems arose in a very early
recognition of three generations or stages of seniority, in
order to hinder sexual relations between relatives in the
ascending and descending line.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> For this reason, and because
of the existence among some backward tribes of significant
terms of kinship, individual marriage must as a
general rule have existed among the Australian natives from
the "earliest times."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Thus, "in its original form," the
author concludes, "the division into classes is a striking confirmation
of Morgan's theory, that the first step in the development
of systems of relationship consists in the prevention
of sexual union between parents and children in the wide
sense."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> For the same reason it follows that intermarriage
between the nearest collateral relatives may not have been
excluded.</p>

<p>Much more radical are the conclusions reached by Kohler
in the monograph in which, by a minute examination of
Morgan's tables and other materials, he seeks to establish
the genetic relations subsisting between "totemism, group-marriage,
and mother-right," as they appear among the
Dravidians, the Australians, and the American aborigines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
The researches of Curr and Westermarck are criticised as
being too general and as lacking in rigid scientific method.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
Abundant "survivals," such as the levirate, wife-lending, and,
above all, the class-system, seem to demonstrate the former
existence of group-marriage in Australia; and in the same
way the same result is reached for the other peoples considered.
The "key" to the problem is found in totemism,
one of the most "formative and vitalizing impulses of mankind.
In totemism lies the germ of the future family and
state."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> It is the characteristic feature of the social and
religious life of the American Indians. From its very nature
totemism favors the rise of mother-right and group-marriage.
No person can belong to more than one totem, which is
therefore of necessity exogamous. Choice must be made
between the maternal and the paternal line&mdash;for totemism
implies the blood-bond. This choice naturally leads directly
to mother-right; since the relation of mother and child
is the central fact in the genesis of social experience.
The maternal system precedes the paternal, and no trustworthy
examples of the opposite evolution have been discovered.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
Furthermore, totemism leads straight to group-marriage.
For if two totem-groups may intermarry, it
follows that the "men of one totem may marry women of
the other and <i>vice versa</i>." With kinship counted in the
maternal line, this fact implies that a man may mate with his
own daughter; while the union of mother and son or brother
and sister would be excluded because of the identity of their
totem.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Totemism is thus a means of differentiating matrimonial
classes. "The whole history of group-marriage," the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
author concludes, "is a history of the restriction of marriage
from totem to totem by the separation of under-totems
through which marriage is subjected to definite conditions."
Totemistic group-marriage appears to be the "starting-point"
of social culture for all the races of mankind. Whether a
more primitive stage of promiscuity may have preceded it,
the author in this paper does not undertake to establish.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Similar results are reached by Spencer and Gillen, who
have given a remarkably clear and minute account of matrimonial,
tribal, and totemistic institutions in central Australia.
So far as the Australians are concerned, the theory that the
classificatory nomenclatures are merely terms of address is
positively rejected.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> "When, in various tribes, we find series
of terms of relationship all dependent upon classificatory
systems such as those now to be described, and referring
entirely to a mutual relationship such as would be brought
about by their existence, we cannot do otherwise than come
to the conclusion that the terms do actually indicate various
degrees of relationship based primarily upon the existence of
inter-marrying groups.... Whatever else they may be,
the relationship terms are certainly not terms of address, the
object of which is to prevent the native having to employ a
personal name. In the Arunta tribe, for example, every man
and woman has a personal name by which he or she is freely
addressed by others&mdash;that is, by any, except a member of
the opposite sex who stands in the relationship of '<i>Mura</i>' to
them, for such may only on very rare occasions speak to one
another."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The fundamental idea of the Australian classes
is "that the women of certain groups may marry the men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
others." It is a device for limiting and defining the inter-marriage
of persons supposed to be of common blood.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Crawley likewise holds that the terms of the classificatory
systems "are terms of kinship and not terms of address;"
although being "in origin terms of <em>relation</em>," so far they
are "terms of address also." For "all of the terms can be
used as terms of address, just as our terms of relationship
can be so used." The classificatory system, in some cases,
appears clearly as a device to assist nature in confining marriage
within the same generation.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>The results of the most recent research, therefore, seem
to have advanced our knowledge of the early social condition
of mankind; but not to have definitively settled the problem
of the former existence of communistic marriage. One rises
from an examination of the literature relating to totemism
and to the classificatory systems of relationship with a feeling
that much more material must be gathered and exploited
before we shall escape entirely from the domain of speculation
as to their full meaning.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<h3>III. McLENNAN'S CONSTRUCTIVE THEORY</h3>

<p>McLennan's theory<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> starts also with man in a condition,
as he conceives it, resembling that of other gregarious animals.
The unions of the sexes are "probably, in the earliest
times, loose, transitory, and in some degree promiscuous."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
There is no idea of consanguinity, though men may always
have been held together by that "feeling of kindred" which
arises in "filial and fraternal affection."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Everywhere when
society emerges from this condition kinship is traced in the
female line. Originally paternity is uncertain,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> hence the
recognition of relationship through the mother must of
necessity have preceded the parental and the agnatic systems;<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
and this order of development is never reversed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the "filial and fraternal affections may be instinctive,"
they are "obviously independent of any theory
of kinship, its origin or consequences; they are distinct
from the perception of the unity of blood upon which kinship
depends; and they may have existed long before kinship
became an object of thought." Such a group may
have been held together chiefly "by the feeling of kindred;"
but the "apparent bond of fellowship ... would be that
they and theirs had always been companions in war or the
chase&mdash;joint-tenants of the same cave or grove."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Slowly
the idea of blood-relationship arose; and eventually observation
led to a recognition of the system of kinship through
the mother. Further than this, so long as paternity remained
uncertain, primitive men could not go. For the
theory in question, therefore, the maternal system of kinship
existing in the homogeneous "group-stock" is the
social fact of fundamental importance. But primitive man
was rude, ignorant, relatively helpless. "Before the invention
of the arts, and the formation of provident habits, the
struggle for existence must often have become very serious.
The instincts of self-preservation, therefore, must have frequently
predominated." Society would tend toward one common
type in which there was little place for the "unselfish
affections." In this "struggle for food and security" the
balance of the sexes would be disturbed. "As braves and
hunters were required and valued, it would be to the interest
of every horde to rear, when possible, its healthy male children."
The weaker sex must obey the cruel law requiring
the "survival of the fittest." Hence arose the common,
perhaps general, practice of female infanticide.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The result
of this disturbance of the balance of the sexes, caused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
female infanticide, was a series of customs or phenomena of
great sociological interest, requiring notice in the order in
which they are supposed to have arisen.</p>

<p>1. The natural consequence of the diminution in the
number of women was to enhance their relative importance.
Every woman would now have several wooers. Rivalry was
fierce and "unrestrained by any sense of delicacy from a
copartnery in sexual enjoyments." Quarrels and divisions
within the horde would be of frequent occurrence. "These
were the first wars for women, and they went to form the
habits which established exogamy." But, if complete social
disintegration would be avoided, self-preservation required
a compromise. A rearrangement in smaller hordes took
place; and so "we arrive at last at groups within which
harmony was maintained through indifference and promiscuity;"
where women, "like other goods," were held in
common; and "children, while attached to mothers," belonged
to the horde.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> We have reached in fact, as the
first result of female infanticide, the "totem <i>gens</i>" or group
of totem kindred, having a common name, taken from some
plant, heavenly body, or animal, whose image is sometimes
tattooed upon their bodies, and which is sometimes revered
as an ancestor, sometimes as an ancestral god.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The next institution originating in scarcity of women
is polyandry, a form of sexual relations which, by the adherents
of the horde-theory, is regarded as the earliest type of
the family, properly so called: a family resting upon marriage,
that is, upon a courtship "of men and women, protected
by public opinion."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> It is of special interest, because
in its progressive phases it is held to be the medium of
transition from the maternal to the parental and agnatic
systems of kinship; and, therefore, through the aid of contract
in the form of wife-purchase, to modern conceptions of
the marriage relation. Polyandry is represented as a universal
phase of social evolution, constituting the first general
modification of promiscuity.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Of this there are two
principal forms with intermediate stages. In Nair<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> polyandry,
the lowest type, we find a condition of sexual relations
closely bordering upon the grossest communism. The
"wife lives not with her husbands, but with her mother or
brothers;" and, under certain "restrictions as to tribe and
caste," she is free to choose her husbands or lovers, these
not being necessarily related to each other. Here kinship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and inheritance are, of course, in the female line. "No
Nair knows his father, and every man looks upon his sister's
children as his heirs."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> In a transitional stage the wife has
a home of her own, cohabiting with her husbands according
to fixed rules. The highest type of polyandry is found in
Tibet; and in this case there is a close approach to the
essential elements of the modern family. The wife lives in
the home of her husbands, who are near relatives, usually
brothers. It is the prerogative of the eldest brother to
choose the wife. All the children are assumed to belong to
him, and, as a matter of fact, the first-born is usually known
to be his. Paternity therefore is not entirely uncertain,
while the father's blood is always known.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The same type
of polyandry, somewhat more advanced, appears among the
Dravidian Todas of India. Here monogamy and polyandry
exist side by side. One man, for example, may have a wife
exclusively his own, while his brothers may choose one in
common. Usually when one brother has taken a woman to
wife, and paid the dower to her parents, the other brothers
or very near relatives, all living together, may gain the
rights of husbands, "if both he and she consent," by simply
providing their respective shares of the dower, which almost
invariably consists of from one to four buffaloes.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> According
to Marshall, "no females, whether married or single, possess
property; but, under all circumstances of life, are supported
by their male relations, being fed from the common stock."
When "a father dies, his personal property is divided equally
among all his sons. If the deceased, being an elder brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
should have no sons, his next brother inherits all the property.
All children of both sexes belong to the father's
family; and inheritance runs through the male line only.
Thus (1) if a widow should re-marry, her sons by both marriages
have claims on their respective father's property.
(2) If one or more women are in common to several men,
<em>each</em> husband considers <em>all</em> the children as his&mdash;though
each woman is mother only to her own&mdash;and each male
child is an heir to the property of all of the fathers." Moreover,
there exists a kind of levirate. "In order to avoid the
complications that would arise, in the matter of food and the
guardianship of property, from the re-marriage of widows,
if they entered other families taking their children with
them, either a brother or other near relation of her deceased
husband takes her to wife." She "remained in the family"
is the Toda expression.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> "Now if we consider that one or
more brothers may each become the husband of separate
wives by virtue of having each paid a dower, and that
younger brothers as they grow to age of maturity, and
other brothers as they become widowed, may each either
take separate wives or purchase shares in those already in
the family, we can at once understand that any degree of
complication in perfectly lawful wedded life may be met
with, from the sample of the single man living with a single
wife to that of the group of relatives married to a group of
wives. We begin to see also why tribes following polyandrous
habits endeavor to prevent further complications by
making widows 'remain in the family.'" It follows that
economic motives even here are influential in molding matrimonial
institutions. The same motives, the scarcity of subsistence,
are likewise the main cause of the very extended
female infanticide which widely prevailed previous to 1822,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
when the Madras government "put a pressure on the Todas,
in order to impel them to forsake their murderous practice."
It was formerly the habitual custom to smother "all daughters
in every family, except one or sometimes two."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The
Todas are an in-and-in breeding people. "Although there
<em>are</em> degrees of kinship, within whose limits the union of the
sexes is held in actual abhorrence, yet half brothers and
sisters are not included amongst the objectionables."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, through polyandry, it is held, the transition
to the parental or paternal system of kinship becomes possible,
and sooner or later it usually takes place. Among the
Todas father-right is fully established. In Tibet the inheritance
goes to the brothers in the order of birth; and, failing
these, to their eldest son, who, as already seen, is often
known to be the eldest brother's child. This rule, it is maintained,
may readily lead to agnation. Nevertheless the primitive
custom of mother-right was very tenacious. Resisted by
the gentile organization and the blood-feud, the transition was
slow and painful. It was facilitated by contract and initiation.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
A woman might be bought with the understanding
that the children should belong, not to her own clan, but to
that of her husband. Or, when contract alone was not sufficient
to overcome the resistance of religion and the blood-feud,
the same result might be obtained by purchase, followed
by initiation into the sacred rites of the husband's kindred.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
Moreover, as in Tibet and among the Todas, wife-purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
or its survival is sometimes found in connection with polyandry.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>McLennan believes that Tibetan polyandry has been
nearly, if not quite, universal, and that it is an "advance
upon the Nair type." Many evidences of its alleged actual
existence in present and former times are adduced; and where
the institution is not found reliance is placed upon the presence
of certain customs, such as the Niyoga, or the "appointed
daughter," of the Hindus, the Hebrew levirate, and the inheritance
by brothers, which are held to be its survivals.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>3. The disparity in the number of women would next
produce the custom of wife-capture. The normal condition
of primitive men is assumed to be that of strife.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Women
would naturally be sought as the most valuable of the spoils
of war. This would lead to polygyny. Since there can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
no certainty as to fatherhood where the practice of seizing
the women from hostile tribes obtains, wife-capture is the
means of maintaining the system of counting kinship through
the women only; and the existence of that system, at some
time, must be inferred wherever wife-capture or its form in
the marriage ceremony is discovered.</p>

<p>4. Wife-capture leads directly to exogamy, or the rule of
not marrying within the group of recognized kindred; that
is, at first, among those having the same totem. Exogamy
is therefore not regarded as the result of a prejudice against
intermarriage of those related by blood. For a time, doubtless,
marriage within and without the group was practiced
indifferently, as pleasure or opportunity favored. But
eventually the possession of a foreign woman was looked
upon as the more honorable or respectable; and so at last
marriage within the kindred was entirely forbidden. With
the rise of wife-capture the original homogeneity of the
group gave place to a growing heterogeneity. Soon many
alien stocks were represented in the horde. Where polygyny
existed, or where several wives were taken in succession, the
same family might comprise children representing several
totems. These children like their mothers were counted as
foreigners. Thus a modified form of exogamy arose. "So
far as the system of infanticide allowed, the hordes contained
young men and women accounted of different stocks, who
might intermarry consistently" with the original rule of
exogamy. "Hence grew up a system of betrothals, and of
marriage by sale and purchase." But the effect of the system
of kinship through males, when it superseded the maternal
system, was to "arrest the progress of heterogeneity,"
and to "restore the original condition of affairs among exogamous
races, as regards both the practice of capturing wives
and the evolution of the forms of capture."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>It would be ungrateful not to acknowledge freely the
service which McLennan and his adherents have rendered to
the social history of mankind. They have brought to light
a mass of very important facts which it is highly beneficial
for us to know. It cannot be denied that wife-capture,
exogamy, and the custom of taking kinship from the mother
have very widely prevailed among primitive races. It is
not so certain, however, that the right explanation of their
origin or of their relation to one another has been given.
In the first place, criticism, notably that of Herbert Spencer,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
has detected fatal weakness and inconsistency in the argument
by which Mr. McLennan has sought to establish his
theory. It is doubtful, for instance, whether female infanticide
has been so important a factor in social evolution.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
But, granting that it has generally prevailed, it is hard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
see how this would greatly disturb the "balance of the
sexes." For "tribes in a state of chronic hostility are constantly
losing their adult males, and the male mortality so
caused is usually considerable. Hence the killing many
female infants does not necessitate lack of women: it may
merely prevent excess." McLennan's fundamental "assumption
is therefore inadmissible."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Again it is held that female
infanticide, "rendering women scarce, led at once to polyandry
within the tribe, and the capturing of women from
without." But "where wife-stealing is now practiced it is
commonly associated with polygyny;"<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> while conversely,
polyandry does not "distinguish wife-stealing tribes," such
as the Tasmanians, Australians, Dakotas, and Brazilians.
"Contrariwise, though it is not a trait of peoples who rob one
another of their women, it is a trait of certain rude peoples
who are habitually peaceful;" for instance, the Eskimo,
"who do not even know what war is." Furthermore, if
wife-capture and exogamy are at once practiced by a cluster
of adjacent tribes, the scarcity of women would not be
relieved. Inevitably the weaker tribes would "tend toward
extinction;" and in the meantime, if a part only of their
female infants were killed, they must deliberately "rear the
remainder for the benefit" of their enemies.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Nor, as
Starcke has pointed out, is there anything in a "scarcity of
women which could lead a community accustomed to promiscuous
intercourse to adopt polyandry; on the contrary, such
a scarcity would make it more difficult to set limits" to promiscuity.
"Marriage, or the exclusive possession of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
woman by one or more men, would become more easy in
proportion to the increase in the number of women, since
the conflict between the lusts of the men would necessarily
become less intense."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> McLennan believes that exogamy
has "been practiced at a certain stage among every race of
mankind;" and that endogamy, or the custom of marrying
within the kindred, is a "form reached through a long series
of social developments."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Yet, inconsistently with this, he
admits that "the separate endogamous tribes are nearly as
numerous, and they are in some respects as rude, as the
separate exogamous tribes." He goes even farther, declaring
that among a variety of tribes, belonging to "one and
the same original stock," endogamy and exogamy are found
existing side by side.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>Such are some of the results gained simply from an
examination of the reasoning of McLennan. They have
been here enumerated, not only because they afford an
excellent illustration of the extreme complexity of social
problems, but also because they may warn us against the
perils of hasty speculation. It is not merely in matters of
detail that the doctrine of the horde and promiscuity has met
with resistance. Its very foundations have recently been
powerfully assaulted by the adherents of a totally different
view of the origin and development of the human family.
How the phenomena of marriage and kinship will appear
when seen in a new light, we shall next try to discover.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

THEORY OF THE ORIGINAL PAIRING OR MONOGAMOUS
FAMILY</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note</span> III.&mdash;The theory of the pairing family is
not so much the result of a reaction against the theory of promiscuity
as it is a consequence of the perception that the problems of society
can only be solved by appealing to the laws of human life and organic
evolution. Hence Starcke's highly original <cite>Primitive Family</cite> (New
York, 1889), and Westermarck's more elaborate and very able treatise
on <cite>Human Marriage</cite> (London and New York, 1891), showing the influence
in some passages of Starcke's acute reasoning, may fairly be
regarded as epoch-making. Important also are Wake's <cite>Marriage and
Kinship</cite> (London, 1889) and Letourneau's <cite>L'évolution du mariage</cite>
(Paris, 1888), which is supplemented by his <cite>Sociology Based upon
Ethnology</cite> (London, 1893). These writers have carried farther the suggestions
of Darwin, <cite>Descent of Man</cite> and <cite>Animals and Plants under
Domestication</cite>; and Spencer, <cite>Principles of Sociology</cite> (New York, 1879),
who had already thrown doubt upon the communistic theory. A similar
general conclusion is reached in the valuable monograph of Kautsky,
"Entstehung der Ehe und Familie," in <cite>Kosmos</cite>, XII (Stuttgart, 1882),
whose original "hetairism" is but "defective monogamy;" and
Peschel's <cite>Races of Man</cite> (London, 1889) tends in the same direction.
Hildebrand likewise rejects the communistic theory in his inaugural
address on <cite>Das Problem einer allgemeinen Entwicklungsgeschichte des
Rechts und der Sitte</cite> (Graz, 1894); and this work should be read in connection
with his <cite>Recht und Sitte auf den verschiedenen wirthschaftlichen

<h3>I. THE PROBLEM OF PROMISCUITY</h3>

<p>The researches of several recent writers, notably those of
Starcke and Westermarck, confirming in part and further
developing the earlier conclusions of Darwin and Spencer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
have established a probability that marriage or pairing
between one man and one woman, though the union be often
transitory and the rule frequently violated, is the typical
form of sexual union from the infancy of the human race.
The problem is not yet fully worked out; but if in the end
the theory of original promiscuity must be abandoned, and
the pairing or monogamous family accepted as the primitive
social unit, it is not because of the spiritual and moral superiority
of man, as compared with other animals, but because
sexual communism as a primitive and general phase of life
appears to be inconsistent with the biological, economic, and
psychological laws which have determined the general course
of organic evolution. Strongly supported and highly probable
as is the pairing or monogamic theory, it must be
clearly understood in the outset that it is still only a theory
and has not yet reached the stage of demonstration. It
will hardly do, however, to set aside the researches of its
adherents as being superficial and devoid of real scientific
method; for the champions of the opposite doctrine of primitive
communism are nothing if not daring, and their sweeping
generalizations often rest solely on comparatively few
"survivals" of alleged conditions which are absolutely "prehistoric."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>It may be impossible to prove that there ever was a uniform
primitive state. "So long as we are within the sphere
of experience," says Starcke, "we cannot begin by assuming
that there was at any time only a single human community.
Experience begins with a plurality of communities, and the
single community of which we are in search must be found
on the indeterminate boundary between man and animals."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Indeed, it seems certain that if we are ever to understand
the character of the earliest forms of human marriage and
the human family, we must begin by studying the family
and marriage as they exist among other and less advanced
members of the animal world.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Biology, declares Letourneau,
is the starting-point of sociology.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> In this view Starcke coincides.
"We have no reason to regard the social life of
man as a recent form. Not only do the same psychical
forces which influence gregarious man also influence the
gregarious animal; probability also leads us to infer that the
primitive communities of mankind are derived from those of
animals. Since man in so many respects only goes on to
develop the previous achievements of animal experience, it
may be supposed that he made use of the social experience
of animals as the firm foundation of his higher advancement."
Besides, "there are human communities which are
far less firmly established than those of animals;" and "it
may even be asserted that the social faculty is positive in
animals and negative in man," for man is "less subservient
to instinct."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> "If we want to find out the origin of marriage,"
says Westermarck, "we have to strike into another path, the
only one which can lead to the truth, but a path which is
open to him alone who regards organic nature as one continued
chain, the last and most perfect link of which is man.
For we can no more stop within the limits of our own species,
when trying to find the root of our psychical and social
life, than we can understand the physical condition of the
human race without taking into consideration that of the
lower animals."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly three principal arguments against the existence
at any time of a general state of promiscuity have been
advanced:</p>

<p>First is the so-called zoölogical argument, based on a
comparison of the sexual habits and institutions of animals
with those of the lowest races of men. In the outset it is
important to observe that the physical differentiation of the
sexes is itself a product of the struggle for existence. This
important fact is made the starting-point of the argument by
which Hellwald<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> finds the elements of the human mother-group
and of mother-right in earlier animal experiences.
Among the lowest members of the animal kingdom there is
no individual distinction of sex. That first makes its appearance
when the "artistically constructed organism, in order
to sustain itself in the process of evolution, is called upon to
perform a wider series of functions." Thus "when an animal
is forced to greater exertion, when it must work in order
to exist, when unresistingly it can no longer suffer the
stream of events to press upon it, but withstands it and
seeks in it to follow its own course, then the separation of
the sexes appears, and, indeed, as a division of labor created
by nature for the purpose of developing species." With
further evolution, male and female characteristics become
more pronounced, in response to the special functions which
each sex is called upon to perform. The same process continues
in the case of man. To see in him anything other
than the "highest and foremost representative of the animal
world, one must be drunk with metaphysical nectar, and
nothing is better fitted than comparative physiology to
humble one's pride in this regard." For man's entire
physical organization is "homologous to that of the higher
species of animals." Accordingly, the lower a group of
men stands on the ladder of culture, the less marked is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
"bodily differentiation of the sexes." Among various backward
peoples there is relatively slight difference in outward
appearance between the men and the women.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The growth
of sexual variation in physical structure keeps pace exactly
with progress in civilization. This progress depends mainly
on two original forces. Of these "without doubt the
mightiest is hunger," the need of nourishment. For everywhere
on earth the "first thought and striving" of living
beings is the "stilling of hunger." Next to the struggle
for food, the sexual and pairing impulse is the most potent
factor in the genesis of society. The former influence, it is
important to observe, is the more constant and the more
imperative. The latter grows and becomes more acute with
increase in refinement and the consequent development of
the nervous system.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> It follows that in the origin of social
institutions the erotic or pairing impulse, however important,
is a less cogent genetic force than the economic necessity
of a food supply.</p>

<p>The lives of the lower animals reveal a great variety of
sexual relations. The lowest form, and perhaps the most
frequent, is that of unlimited promiscuity.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Among the
invertebrates the preservation of the young is left almost
wholly to chance. The duties of the parents are limited
mainly to the functions of reproduction. "In the lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
classes of vertebrata, parental care is likewise almost unheard
of." It "rarely happens that both parents jointly take care
of their progeny."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> But the chelonia, or tortoise group, are
"known to live in pairs;" and here we reach, among animals,
the first trace of the family, properly so called. "The
chelonia form, with regard to their domestic habits, a transition
to the birds, as they do also from a zoölogical and, particularly,
from an embryological point of view." Who that
has experienced the keen delight afforded by watching the
domestic habits of birds, from the building of the nest to
the teaching of the young to make the first wavering trial
of its wings, cannot bear witness to the high development
of marriage and the family among them? The great work
of Brehm supplies abundant evidence of their human-like
social life.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> "Parental affection," summarizes Westermarck,
"has reached a very high degree of development, not only
on the mother's side, but also on the father's. Male and
female help each other to build the nest, the former generally
bringing the materials, the latter doing the work. In
fulfilling the numberless duties of the breeding season both
birds take a share. Incubation rests principally with the
mother, but the father, as a rule, helps his companion, taking
her place when she wants to leave the nest for a moment, or
providing her with food and protecting her from every
danger. Finally, when the duties of the breeding season
are over, and the result desired is obtained, a period with
new duties commences. During the first few days after
hatching, most birds rarely leave their young for long, and
then only to procure food for themselves and their family.
In cases of great danger, both parents bravely defend their
offspring. As soon as the first period of helplessness is over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and the young have grown somewhat, they are carefully
taught to shift for themselves; and it is only when they are
perfectly capable of so doing that they leave the nest and
the parents."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The bird family is usually monogamic, and
the marriage is lasting. Birds are generally faithful to the
marriage vow; and this is particularly true of the females.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
"With the exception of those belonging to the gallinaceous
family, when pairing," they do so "once for all till either
one or the other dies.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> And Dr. Brehm is so filled with
admiration for their exemplary family life that he enthusiastically
declares that 'real genuine marriage can only be
found among the birds.'"<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>With the lower mammals the union of the sexes is generally
of short duration, often only for a single birth, though
in several species the parents remain together even after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the arrival of the young. But among the higher members
examples of monogamic marriage are not infrequent, such
being the case with animals of prey.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> As a rule, the quadrumana
live in pairs. Gorillas, however, are said sometimes
to be polygynous. "According to Dr. Savage, they live in
bands, and all his informants agree in the assertion that but
one adult male is seen in every band."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> But monogamy is
perhaps most common. M. du Chaillu declares that he
found "almost always one male with one female, though
sometimes the old male wanders companionless."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The
orang-utan and the chimpanzee, like the gorilla, also live in
families.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Of a truth, promiscuity is far from universal in
the pre-human stage.</p>

<p>Yet it would be easy to overestimate the value of the
argument based upon the sexual relations of the lower
animals. But it will not do with Kohler and Lippert to
set it aside as entirely irrelevant.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Upon the precedents
afforded by "anthropomorphic" species in particular, as
Hellwald justly insists, no "slight weight should be placed;"
for these are "not merely the highest organized animals,
but they must also be regarded as the nearest animal relatives
of man."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Indeed, the transition from the family as
it exists among the quadrumana to that of the least-developed
races of man is not abrupt, although the lowest
examples of mankind yet observed are advanced beyond the
supposed primitive human stage. The broad characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the one are the characteristics of the other. The "relations
of the sexes are, as a rule, of a more or less durable
character." There is conjugal affection. The immediate
care of the children belongs to the mother. "Among
mammals as well as birds," declares Espinas, "maternal
love is the corner-stone of the family."<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The father is the
protector and provider, although paternal love is more
slowly developed. Like the male among the lower animals,
savage or barbarous man may be "rather indifferent to the
welfare of his wife and children, ... but the simplest
paternal duties are, nevertheless, universally recognized. If
he does nothing else, the father builds the habitation, and
employs himself in the chase and in war."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>But the argument for the pre-human origin of the elements
of marriage and the family does not rest merely upon
precedents of sexual habits. It is based rather upon the
entire experience of animals in the hard struggle for existence.
That struggle, as Hellwald suggests, forced upon
them primarily the problem of food-supply, the need of a
sort of economic co-operation, more lasting in its results
than the pairing instinct. It is the entire social, mental,
and moral product of animal experience, of living together,
so well described among others by Espinas, Schäffle, Groos,
and Wundt, which man in some measure inherited as a rich
legacy from his humbler predecessor.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Accordingly Westermarck
believes that marriage was probably "transmitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
man from some ape-like ancestor, and that there never was
a time when it did not occur in the human race."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> With
Starcke, and in harmony with the view of Hellwald already
quoted, he holds that marriage and the family cannot rest
upon the sexual impulse alone. This is too transitory.
Among animals it is obvious that "it cannot be the sexual
instinct that keeps male and female together for months
and years," for the "generative power is restricted to a
certain season;" and it seems highly probable that among
men a pairing season prevailed in ancient times. Thus the
"wild Indians of California, belonging to the lowest races
on earth," are said to "have their rutting seasons as regularly
as have the deer, the elk, the antelope, or any other
animals."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> According to Powers, the California Kabinapek
"are extremely sensual. In the spring when the wild clover
is lush and full of blossoms and they are eating it to a satiety
after the famine of winter, they become amorous. This season,
therefore, is a literal Saint Valentine's Day with them,
as with the natural beasts and birds of the forest."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The
Tasmanians, the Australian Watch-an-dies, and various other
peoples appear to show evidences of the same habit.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Vignoli
reaches a similar conclusion. "The family union in which
man originally finds himself is not an essentially human but
likewise an animal fact, since that mode of common social
life is found with the greater part of animals and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
among the higher. It is the necessity of rearing the young
which unites the parents and gives them a common life for
a shorter or longer period; indeed in some species this
marriage of love and care continues throughout their whole
existence. Hence the fact of family sociality is not an
exclusive product of humanity, but of the universal laws of
the whole animal life upon the earth. Let it not be asserted
that in man affection between the sexes and toward their
offspring ... is more active, more intense, and more lasting;
for it manifests itself with equal strength and sometime
with equal duration between animals and toward their young.
Thus man loves, cohabits, and lives socially in a primitive
family community only because he is an animal and moreover
an animal higher in the organic series. So the fact of
the family is consummated according to the necessity of
cosmic laws governing a great part of the reproductive and
social activity of the animal kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>According to Starcke, "we are in some respects disposed
to underestimate the great influence which sexual matters
exert on all the concerns of social life, and the attempt is
sometimes made to sever it from moral life, as a matter of
which we are constrained to admit the practical existence,
although, from the ideal point of view, it ought not to be.
On the other hand, its influence on primitive communities
has been greatly overrated." The sexual instinct, however
powerful, is "devoid of the conditions which form the basis
of the leading tendencies in which man's struggle for existence
must be fought out." Hence primitive marriage does
not rest upon the tender sentiment which we call love,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> but
"as hard and dry as private life itself," it has its "origin in
the most concrete and prosaic requirements." The "common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
household," he continues, "in which each had a given
work to do, and the common interest of obtaining and rearing
children were the foundations upon which marriage was
originally built."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Therefore, according to this view, marriage
appears to be a kind of contractual relation from the
beginning.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The conclusions of Westermarck on this point
are in substantial harmony with those of Starcke: "The prolonged
union of the sexes is, in some way or other, connected
with parental duties.... The tie which joins male and
female is an instinct developed through the powerful influence
of natural selection." This instinct as well as parental
affection are "thus useful mental dispositions which, in all
probability, have been acquired through the survival of the
fittest." So he concludes that "it is for the benefit of the
young that male and female continue to live together. Marriage
is therefore rooted in family, rather than family in
marriage."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Hence it is that among many peoples "true
conjugal life does not begin before a child is born;" and
there are other races who "consider that the birth of a child
out of wedlock makes it obligatory for the parents to marry."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>As a result of the first argument, then, marriage appears
as a fundamental institution, whose beginnings are anterior
to the dawn of human history. But there is need of a new
definition, one broad enough to satisfy the demands of
science. For most existing definitions are of a "merely
juridical or ethical nature, comprehending either what is
required to make the union legal, or what, in the eye of an
idealist, the union ought to be." Hence Westermarck
defines marriage, from a scientific point of view, as a "more
or less durable connection between male and female, lasting
beyond the mere act of propagation till after the birth of
offspring;" and Starcke, in like spirit, declares that marriage
in the widest sense is "only a connection between man
and woman which is of more than momentary duration, and
as long as it endures they seek for subsistence in common."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The second or physiological argument may be very briefly
stated. It rests upon the evidence, referred to by Sir Henry
Maine, that promiscuous intercourse between the sexes "tends
nowadays to a pathological condition very unfavorable to
fecundity; and infecundity, amid perpetually belligerent
savages, implies weakness and ultimate destruction."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Thus
Dr. Carpenter, "who visited the West Indies before the
abolition of slavery, well remembers the efforts of the
planters to form the negroes into families, as the promiscuity
into which they were liable to fall produced infertility, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
fertility had become important to the slave-owner through
the prohibition of the slave-trade."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Again "it is a well-known
fact that prostitutes very seldom have children, while,
according to Dr. Roubaud, those of them who marry young
easily become mothers."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Furthermore, as Westermarck
urges, "in a community where all the women equally
belonged to all the men, the younger and prettier ones
would of course be most sought after, and take up a position
somewhat akin to that of the prostitutes of modern society."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
Nor is the objection, that "the practice of polyandry prevails
among several peoples without any evil results as regards
fecundity being heard of," insuperable. For "polyandry
scarcely ever implies continued promiscuous intercourse of
many men with one woman;" and where it exists the relations
of the woman with her husbands is often so regulated
as to make the union practically monogamous.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> In this connection
also should be considered the infertility and other
evils resulting from the intermarriage of near kindred.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> For
in a state of promiscuity such unions must have been very
frequent; and at one stage of social development, if the
theory of Morgan were to be accepted, they must have constituted
the general rule.</p>

<p>According to Westermarck, the strongest objection to
ancient promiscuity "is derived from the psychical nature
of man and other animals."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The third or psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
argument therefore alleges the universal prevalence of sexual
jealousy among the races of men.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Darwin declares that
this passion is found among all male quadrupeds with which
he is acquainted; and comes to the conclusion, therefore,
that "looking far enough back in the stream of time, and
judging from the social habits of man as he now exists, the
most probable view is that he aboriginally lived in small
communities, each with a single wife, or if powerful with
several, whom he jealously guarded against all other men."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
That jealousy is unknown among "almost all uncivilized
peoples" is, indeed, asserted by many adherents of the horde
theory.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> But a mass of evidence relating to savage and barbarous
races in all parts of the world shows that such assertions
are without foundation. In many tribes the suspected
wife is exposed to the vengeful fury of the jealous husband.
For example, among the California Indians, according to
Powers, "if a married woman is seen even walking in the
forest with another man than her husband she is chastised
by him;" and "a repetition of the offense is generally punished
with speedy death."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> So "among the Creek 'it was
formerly reckoned adultery, if a man took a pitcher of water
off a married woman's head and drank of it.'"<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Women, we are
told, are held in little esteem among the Innuit on the coast
of Labrador; yet "the men are very jealous," and death is
often the penalty for adultery on the part of either spouse.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Magalhães, who visited "more than a hundred villages"
among "thirty tribes" of Brazilian natives, some of them
"already half civilized and others still entirely free from
any participation in our institutions, ideas, and pre-conceived
notions," records as a result of his observations that "there
exists in the Indian family all grades from institutions strict
to a degree exceeding anything history tells us about down
to the community of women.... Thus I know tribes
where there is no marriage, and I know others in which a
woman committing adultery is punished by being burned."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
Moreover, he emphatically warns us that he is speaking here
of the "uncatechised" native, not yet demoralized by missionary
influence.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> According to Dobrizhoffer, the Abipones
of Paraguay are conspicuous for "conjugal fidelity;" and
they are very jealous, taking swift vengeance when infidelity
is suspected.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Souza, who "lived in Brazil, in what is now
the state of Bahia, from 1570 to 1587,"<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> says that "there
are always jealousies among" the wives of the polygamous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Tupinambás, especially on the part of the first wife, because
usually she is "older than the others and less gentle."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> On
the other hand, the Jesuit Anchieta, who was in the same
country "from 1553 until his death in 1597," declares that
women frequently abandon their consorts to take other men
"without any feeling upon the part of the husbands; and I
never saw and never heard of any Indian killing any of his
wives on account of any feeling about adultery;" but his
narrative reveals unmistakable evidence of the existence of
sexual jealousies.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>In fact, among primitive peoples, as suggested by the
preceding examples, death or other severe punishment is
often the penalty for adultery. It is so in Polynesia,
although the fault of the man is usually "condoned;"<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> as
also in Micronesia, where the husband does not escape so
easily.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Extraordinary precautions are sometimes taken to
prevent marriage with an impure bride. Frequently the
husband requires that the "woman he chooses for his wife
shall belong to him, not during his life-time only, but after
his death." Hence the widespread practice of sacrificing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
wife at the death of the husband; and the frequent restraint
upon the remarriage of widows is ascribed to the same cause.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>As a final result of his minute examination, Westermarck
concludes that there is "not a shred of genuine evidence for
the notion that promiscuity ever formed a general stage in
the social history of mankind." The hypothesis, he declares,
is "essentially unscientific." How, then, it may be asked,
can the series of phenomena adduced by McLennan and
others to support that hypothesis be otherwise explained?</p>

<p>In the first place, it is believed, the direct evidence as to
the existence of races living promiscuously in ancient and
modern times will not stand the test of criticism.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Often
the statements of writers and travelers prove on examination
to be erroneous. Thus, for instance, Sir Edward Belcher's
assertion, that among the Andaman Islanders "the custom
is for the man and woman to remain together until the child
is weaned, when they separate, and each seeks a new
partner,"<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> has been "disproved by Mr. Man, who, after a
very careful investigation of this people, says not only that
they are strictly monogamous, but that divorce is unknown,
and conjugal fidelity till death not the exception but the rule
among them."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Sometimes the "facts adduced are not
really instances of promiscuity." This appears to be true,
as already seen, of the alleged Australian group-marriages.
So also the "communism" practiced among the Cahyapós,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
"who seem to be the most numerous tribe of the central
plateaux of Brazil," turns out on examination to be something
very different from promiscuity, resembling more the
"temporary" marriages already mentioned, though combined
with polygyny. "The communism of wives among
them," says Magalhães,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> "is as follows: The woman as soon
as she reaches the age at which she is permitted to have
relations with a man, conceives by the one who pleases her.
During the period of gestation and nursing she is maintained
by the father of the child, who may have others in similar
charge and these others during similar periods live in the
same cabin. As soon as the woman begins to work she is
free to conceive by the same man or she may procure
another, the charge of supporting the earlier offspring passing
to the latter."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> This institution, it is clear, involves
considerable social regulation. Indeed we are particularly
warned that "by communism of women is not to be understood
anything like prostitution.... This distinction is
the more important for the proper comprehension of the
savage family, since it is certain that in those same tribes
where this communism exists, prostitutes are held in great
displeasure." The custom "is a mode of family existence
that they judge best according to their ideas and means of
living." With it Magalhães contrasts the "exclusiveness"
of the neighboring Guatos of the river Plate, in "Brazilian
Paraguay," who are not monogamous, each man having
"one, two, or three wives according to his ability in hunting,
fishing, and the gathering of the different fruits
which make up the base of their food." The women are
exceedingly modest. "If a Guato woman brought us a fish,
some game, wild fruit," or in any way sought "something
of ours that she wanted, she did it always with her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
fixed on the ground or turned toward her husband." The
related Chambioás of the Amazon valley are even more
severe. Among them women are burned for adultery; and
in their "widows' men" they have a curious device for the
preservation of domestic peace.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> All these tribes "guard
with great caution against, and some even punish with
death, the union of the two sexes before the complete
puberty of the woman.... Friar Francisco assured me
that the virginity of the man was strictly maintained until
the epoch of his marriage, and this was not allowed before
he was twenty-five years of age, without even this being the
ordinary thing: marriage is commonly after thirty." As a
principal reason for this usage are assigned the "force and
energy of the offspring."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>Savage tribes are often extremely licentious; but it is
significant that the most immoral are not always lowest in
the scale of development. Besides, it is well known that
"contact with a higher culture, or more properly, the dregs
of it, is pernicious to the morality of peoples living in a
more or less primitive condition."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Nor can promiscuity as
a general social stage be assumed from the existence of some
tribes whose sexual relations are but slightly restrained,
since, as just seen, there are others, not otherwise more
advanced, remarkable for the chastity of the wedded as well
as the unwedded life.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The indirect evidence of a former stage of unrestricted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
sexual relations, based on the existence of certain customs
assumed to be its survival, particularly female kinship,
exogamy, and polyandry, turns out on examination to be even
less convincing than that obtained from direct observation.
Primitive man is usually influenced by extremely simple
motives; and the great fault of speculation has been the
assignment of remote and complex causes for phenomena
which are often capable of easier explanation. "The most
important features of the life of a community," Starcke
observes, "are due to forces at once simple and universal."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>


<h3>II. THE PROBLEM OF MOTHER-RIGHT</h3>

<p>Such is the case with attempts to account for kinship in
the female line. McLennan thinks it "inconceivable" that
it can be due to any cause other than uncertainty of fatherhood;
and he holds therefore that it must have preceded
the paternal system.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Careful research, however, has shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that these assumptions are far from axiomatic. In the first
place, the acute criticism of Friedrichs is deserving of
special attention. Among a number of low races where
relationship with the begetter is not recognized he finds that
certainty of fatherhood through securing the fidelity of the
wife nevertheless exists. The number is small, but a single
certain example, he insists, is sufficient to refute McLennan's
hypothesis. Such an example is provided by Semper<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> in
the case of the people of the Palau Islands; and it is all the
more convincing because here it is only the wife who is
prohibited from general sexual intercourse, while young
girls may give free play to their desires, and in a measure
this is not merely suffered, but even enjoined by social
custom.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Indeed, savages know well how to secure chastity
on the part of their women by such "naïve arts" as infibulation,
so realistically described by Ploss in his well-known
book on woman.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>While not denying that uncertainty of fatherhood may
have been influential in some cases, Spencer argues that
without this assumption it is perfectly natural that the child
should be named from the mother with whom it spends its
early life; and where exogamy prevails the custom would
become a convenient rule for determining who are marriageable
women within the group; for the "requirement that a
wife shall be taken from a foreign tribe readily becomes
confounded with the requirement that a wife shall be of
foreign blood."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Westermarck seeks a simple explanation of female kinship
in the necessary relations of a child with its mother.
"Especially among savages, the tie between a mother and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
child is much stronger than that which binds a child to the
father. Not only has she given birth to it, but she has also
for years been seen carrying it about at her breast. Moreover,
in cases of separation, occurring frequently at lower
stages of civilization, the infant children always follow the
mother, and so, very often, do the children more advanced
in years."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Polygyny has doubtless favored the choice of
the female line of descent;<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> and the odd custom of the
couvade, found here and there among rude peoples, instead
of being a mark of transition to the paternal system, only
implies some connection or "some idea of relationship"
between father and child;<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> and accordingly simpler and
more probable reasons for its origin have been assigned.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Thus it may take its rise in the notion of a mysterious
physical connection between the father and the child. "The
well-being of the child is its object." The father occupies
the so-called lying-in bed, not as a bed of sickness "affording
rest and strength after travail," but he abstains from
certain foods lest they should injure the child, and he
fasts in order that his powers of endurance may be assured
to it.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> This view is strongly supported by the fact that
among many primitive peoples, in various stages of advancement,
the belief is found that the child springs from the
father alone, the mother merely performing the function of
nourishment.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Finally Westermarck's generalization as to
the real import of kinship through females only may be
noted. The "facts adduced as examples" of this system,
he declares, "imply chiefly that children are named after
their mothers, not after their fathers, and that property and
rank succeed exclusively in the female line."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Starcke has devoted the first half of his book to a detailed
investigation of the problem of female descent, and comes
to the conclusion that it depends mainly on local and economic
causes. He first shows that the clan is of later origin
than the family; and holds that these are by nature very
different institutions. The family is juridical, established
by contract, and only "in a subsidiary sense" founded on
the "tie of blood between parents and children;" but the
clan is a natural and homogeneous group of kindred among
whom degrees of relationship are not counted. It is an
exclusive group into which the child is born; and "it is
absolutely impossible for one person to belong to two distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
clans."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> In the primitive stage, before the formation
of clans, the family must always be a more or less isolated
group. The man usually chooses the place of abode, and
hence paternal kinship may be easily recognized. A considerable
number of rude peoples exist who take kinship
from the father;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and Starcke is inclined to believe, though
he presents rather slender evidence, that as a general rule
the paternal precedes the maternal system. With the rise
of the clan organization, it became absolutely necessary for
the local groups to take one system or the other. So the
"definition of kinship results from the conflict between clans,
and teaches us nothing further with respect to the child's
relation to its parent. The choice between the two possible
lines is decided by the economic organization of the community
and by the local grouping of individuals, but there
is not the slightest trace of the fact that considerations with
respect to the sexual relations had any influence in the
matter."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>Starcke's opinion that such rules of succession depend on
local connections, those persons being each other's heirs
"who dwell together in one place,"<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> seems to gain some
support from the result of Dr. Tylor's examination of the
so-called "beena"<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> marriage form, which requires the man
to live in the family of his wife, usually serving for her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
did Jacob for Laban's daughters. It is remarkable that this
custom and the maternal system of kinship are commonly
found together. "Thus the number of coincidences between
peoples where the husband lives with the wife's family and
where the maternal system prevails, is naturally large in
proportion, while the full maternal system as naturally never
appears among peoples whose exclusive custom is for the
husband to take his wife to his own home."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Furthermore,
adds Westermarck, "where both customs&mdash;the woman receiving
her husband in her own hut, and the man taking his
wife to his&mdash;occur side by side among the same people,
descent in the former cases is traced through the mother, in
the latter through the father."<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>It seems certain that the whole truth regarding the
problems of kinship, as well as regarding the rise and
sequence of the forms of the family, can be reached only
through a thorough historical investigation of the industrial
habits of mankind. In fact, the position of Starcke, that
the rise of rules of descent and kinship depends mainly on
economic and local causes, is strengthened in a remarkable
way by the researches of Grosse, which have already been
presented in outline. Nowhere does promiscuity appear
among the peoples known to history or ethnology; and
everywhere, even among the "lower hunters," comprising
the most backward members of the human kind, appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the single family in which the man holds the place of power,
which is often despotic. There is no definite sequence
between the maternal and the paternal systems. The existence
of either depends upon favorable economic conditions;
and they may both appear side by side. In fact, according to
Cunow, among the lower hunters, with the single exception
of the Australians, the custom of female descent has not yet
been discovered; and even in Australia it is precisely the
most advanced tribes among which the maternal system
appears. It first arises when women are sought outside of
the original horde, in order to prevent intermarriage of
maternal kindred.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>In the light of present research, therefore, the most that
can safely be admitted concerning the system of kinship
through females only is that it has widely existed among
the races of mankind;<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> although, as elsewhere shown, its
prevalence has been greatly exaggerated. Partially under
the influence of monogamy and the rise of modern forms
of property, it has often been superseded by the parental
and sometimes by the agnatic system, although this sequence
is by no means invariable. It is very archaic, yet not necessarily
primitive. There is no satisfactory evidence that it
implies an original stage of promiscuity. It is not impossible,
in view of the facts disclosed by Starcke, that sometimes
it may be preceded by a custom in which the child is
named from the father, and rank and property descend in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>

stage, before rules of descent were yet subjects of reflection,
a kind of patriarchate or androcracy generally prevailed.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>


<h3>III. THE PROBLEM OF EXOGAMY</h3>

<p>The case is much the same with the problem of exogamy,
which is closely connected with the question of kinship.
According to McLennan, as already seen, exogamy, or the
prohibition of marriage within the clan, owes its rise to wife-capture
occasioned by scarcity of women through female
infanticide; and it is contrasted with the opposite custom of
endogamy, which, it is alleged, usually implies a higher
stage of civilization. This account of its origin, he thinks,
is, on the whole, the "only one which will bear examination."</p>

<p>How far it really falls short of the truth was first pointed
out by Herbert Spencer. "In all times and places, among
savage and civilized," he says, "victory is followed by
pillage. Whatever portable things of worth the conquerors
find, they take.... The taking of women is manifestly
but a part of this process of spoiling the vanquished.
Women are prized as wives, as concubines, as drudges; and,
the men having been killed, the women are carried off along
with the other moveables." Thus "women-stealing" is an
"incident of successful war." But a woman so taken has
a double value. "Beyond her intrinsic value she has an
extrinsic value. Like a native wife, she serves as a slave:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
but unlike a native wife, she serves also as a trophy." A
warrior possessing such a token of prowess gains social distinction.
"In a tribe not habitually at war, or not habitually
successful in war, no decided effect is likely to be produced
on the marriage customs." But in warlike and successful
tribes an "increasing ambition to get foreign wives" will
arise. Among savages, proofs of courage are often required
as qualifications for marriage. Hence it is not surprising
that the abduction of a foreign woman should be accepted
as the best proof of all. "What more natural than that
where many warriors of the tribe are distinguished by stolen
wives, the stealing of a wife should become the required
proof of fitness to have one? Hence would follow a peremptory
law of exogamy." Spencer's interpretation, therefore,
agrees with that of McLennan in finding the origin of
exogamy in wife-capture and in implying that usage grows
into law. But it does not, "like his, assume either that this
usage originated in a primordial instinct, or that it resulted
from a scarcity of women caused by infanticide.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Moreover,
unlike Mr. McLennan's, the explanation so reached is consistent
with the fact that exogamy and endogamy in many
cases co-exist; and with the fact that exogamy often co-exists
with polygyny;" nor does it "involve us in the difficulty
raised by supposing a peremptory law of exogamy to be
obeyed throughout a cluster of tribes." For if exogamy
would be likely to arise in tribes usually successful in war,
peaceful tribes and those usually worsted in war, though
living side by side with the successful and warlike, would be
naturally led to adopt the rule of endogamy. Furthermore,
among tribes not differing much from one another in
strength, endogamy and exogamy may coexist. "Stealing
of wives will not be reprobated, because the tribes robbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
are not too strong to be defied; and it will not be insisted on,
because the men who have stolen wives will not be numerous
enough to determine the average opinion." Spencer also
maintains that the symbol of rape in the marriage ceremony
does not necessarily imply the previous existence either of
foreign wife-stealing or of exogamy, assigning three other
reasons which singly or together may account for it. First,
it may result from a struggle for women within the tribe.
"There still exist rude tribes in which men fight for possession
of women, the taking possession of a woman naturally
comes as a sequence to an act of capture. That monopoly
which constitutes her a wife in the only sense known by the
primitive man is a result of successful violence."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Secondly,
contrary to the view of Sir John Lubbock,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> the symbol of
rape may be due to the struggle of the bride and her female
friends, many manifestations of which are found in the marriage
customs of primitive races; though the dread of harsh
treatment is thought to be an additional motive. But
Starcke, doubting whether among savages there is much to
choose between the brutality of the husband and that of the
father, thinks the weeping of the woman merely symbolizes
her sorrow "on leaving her former home; her close dependence
on her family is expressed by her lamentation." The
existence of such symbols is not surprising in "communities
of which the family bond is the alpha and omega."<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The
ceremony of capture, finally, may be due to the resistance of
the father and other male friends of the bride. A woman has
an economic value, "not only as a wife but also as a daughter;
and all through, from the lowest to the highest stages of
social progress, we find a tacit or avowed claim to her service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
by her father." Her service is an object of purchase; and
in English law "we have evidence that it was originally so
among ourselves: in an action for seduction the deprivation
of a daughter's services is the injury alleged."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock is likewise an adherent of the view
that exogamy originates in wife-capture; but he connects
his explanation with his peculiar theory of the communistic
family, and it cannot therefore be accepted, if that theory is
to be rejected.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> He holds that originally all the men and
women of a tribe lived in sexual communism and individual
marriage was looked upon "as an infringement of communal
right." But "if a man captured a woman belonging to
another tribe he thereby acquired an individual and peculiar
right to her, and she became his exclusively." In this way,
the practice of capturing foreign wives led to individual marriage,
and its evident advantages eventually produced the
rule of exogamy. Accordingly, the "symbol of rape became
such an important part of the wedding ceremonies, because
it was the symbol of giving up the woman to become the
exclusive possession of one man."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> McLennan, however,
criticises this view on the ground that "in almost all cases
the form of capture is the symbol of a group act&mdash;of a
siege, or a pitched battle, or an invasion of a house by an
armed band." Seldom does it represent a capture by an
individual. "On the one side are the kindred of the husband;
on the other the kindred of the wife." Furthermore, if
women were commonly captured by the men of a group or
parties of them, as he justly observes, it is hard to see how
an individual who had captured a woman could appropriate
her more easily than he could appropriate any woman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
his own group for whom he had a fancy.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Very different is
the explanation offered by Tylor, who regards exogamy as
the primitive mode of alliance and "political self-preservation."
"Among tribes of low culture there is but one means known
of keeping up permanent alliance, and that means is intermarriage."
Often the alternative has been "marrying out"
or "being killed out." Endogamy, on the other hand, "is
a policy of isolation, cutting off a horde or village, even from
the parent stock whence it separated."<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> That exogamy has
often, perhaps generally, served the political purpose suggested
by Tylor is not improbable, and his view is sustained
by that of Post and Kohler;<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> but this will not account for
its origin.</p>

<p>Both Lubbock and Spencer, it will be observed, agree
with McLennan in assigning the origin of exogamy to wife-capture.
On the other hand, a group of writers, differing
widely on ancillary questions, unite in identifying the causes
which have produced exogamy with those which, in general,
have led to the establishment of forbidden degrees of consanguinity
in marriage. In other words, tribal or clan
exogamy is but one of many rules for the prevention of close
intermarriage between kindred. It must be admitted that a
profound horror of incest is now "an almost universal
characteristic of mankind, the cases which seem to indicate
a perfect absence of this feeling being so exceedingly rare
that they must be regarded merely as anomalous aberrations
from a general rule."<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> But, from the beginning, has there
been an innate aversion to the sexual union of persons closely
related by blood? Is that aversion derived from experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the injurious results of such unions? Did it originally
extend only to marriage and not to irregular sexual connections?
Or, finally, is it the indirect result of a custom,
such as wife-capture, hardening into a rule of forbidden
degrees? These are questions to which very different
answers have been given.</p>

<p>Adherents of the horde theory, of course, deny that horror
of incest is a primitive instinct. Such is the view also of
Spencer, who thinks that "regular relations of the sexes are
results of evolution, and that the sentiments upholding them
have been gradually established,"<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> though&mdash;somewhat inconsistently,
as we have seen&mdash;he agrees with McLennan in
regarding exogamy as the result of custom growing into law.
Lubbock takes a similar position, denying that we can
"attribute to savages any such farsighted ideas" as the
recognition of the injurious effects of close intermarriage.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
On the other hand, Morgan, whose consanguine family
implies the absence of any primitive abhorrence of incest,
considers exogamy "explainable, and only explainable as a
reformatory movement to break up the intermarriage of
blood relations," thus implying that the aversion to such a
union is derived from experience.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> But knowledge which
"can only be gained by lengthened observation," Dr. Peschel
believes, "is 'unattainable by unsettled and childishly heedless
races,' among whom, nevertheless, a horror of incest is
developed most strongly."<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Sir Henry Maine, on the contrary,
"cannot see why the men who discovered the use of
fire and selected the wild forms of certain animals for
domestication and of vegetables for cultivation should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
find out that children of unsound constitution were born of
nearly related parents."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> The researches of Starcke, and
still more those of Westermarck, render it almost certain,
however, that Morgan and Maine are mistaken in their view,
though it may point the way to the truth.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>Starcke's argument leads up to the conclusion that the
basis of exogamy is to be sought in the causes which produced
the clan; for between the clans of a tribe exogamy
almost always prevails, and, without exception, clanless
tribes are "endogamous or at least not exogamous." Furthermore,
tribes divided into clans are usually endogamous as to
the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Now, prohibitions are found which cannot be
due to "exogamy as a definition of the clan;" such is the
prohibition of marriage between mother and son where
agnation is in force, and "between father and daughter
where the uterine line prevails." Since, therefore, "exogamy
as a definition of the clan cannot directly produce these prohibitions,
which are found wherever exogamy occurs, and in
some instances where it is absent," the inference follows
that exogamy must have its origin in the abhorrence of close
intermarriage and the ideas to which that is due. But these
ideas are not necessarily the same as those underlying "the
various prohibited degrees of marriage which are now in
force;" nor do they imply that the injuriousness of such
unions is the ground of the aversion. "In a community
in which marriage takes place between consumptive and
syphilitic persons, and those affected by hereditary disease,
without being condemned by public opinion, and still less by
the law, it cannot be said that the condemnation of incest is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
founded on our regard for posterity."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> In harmony with
his view that marriage is juridical, not founded on sexual
relations, he finds the origin of the horror of marriage
between near kindred in the legal incongruity of such unions
and in their danger to the peculiar constitution of the ancient
family itself. Marriage between a brother and sister or
between a mother and son would usually be impossible
because the "son possesses nothing which he could offer to
the father as purchase-money." To accomplish the purpose
by force would be an "unheard-of crime among savages."
A connection between a father and daughter would seldom
occur, "since a father is unwilling to renounce the advantages
of bestowing his daughter in marriage."<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> "If in this way an
impression arises that there is something unusual and incompatible
with other ideas in marriage between such persons,
an occasional calamity which befalls any of them will be
enough to excite the imaginative faculty in the highest
degree; and if no prohibition previously existed, the absolute
condemnation of such marriages would then be pronounced."
In a word, "the intermarriage of individuals of
the same family implies that persons who have no legal
right to dispose of themselves and their property nevertheless
agree upon such legal disposition, an encroachment
which would certainly be violently opposed by primitive
men." In the same way, exogamy will arise between clans;
and the co-existence of endogamy and exogamy seems to be
consistently explained by this theory. "Exogamy prohibits
marriage between persons who are so nearly related that
they have no legal independence of each other; endogamy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
prohibits the marriage of persons whose legal status is too
remote from each other."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> In corroboration of his view,
Starcke finds evidence that, here and there, a distinction is
made between regular marriage and sexual intercourse, the
former being forbidden, unless for special reasons, while the
latter is allowed.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>If Starcke's explanation of the origin of the dread of close
intermarriage between kindred is too vague and ill supported
by definite proof, his original suggestion that exogamy must
take its rise in that horror is sustained and placed on a
broader foundation by the singularly interesting researches
of Westermarck<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>&mdash;a scholar who has rendered to social
science a very important service by carrying the principles
of organic evolution into the sphere of domestic institutions.
He starts with the assertion that horror of incest is universal.
Writers have, indeed, collected evidence which they believe
points to a time when such an aversion did not exist. Thus
marriage with a sister is permitted in Ceylon and Annam;
in the royal families of Siam, Burma, and the Sandwich
Islands; while the same custom prevailed, as is well known,
among the Ptolemies of Egypt, and among the kings of
ancient Persia.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> But these unions are either "anomalous
aberrations" from the general rule; or else they are allowed
in order to preserve the purity of caste or the royal blood;
or, in case of half-sisters, because relationship is traced in
one line only;<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> while occasionally they may result from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
"extreme isolation" or from "vitiated instincts."<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Everywhere
prohibitions exist, though they vary greatly in the
"degrees of kinship within which union is forbidden." As
a rule, "among peoples unaffected by modern civilization the
prohibited degrees are more numerous than in advanced
communities, the prohibitions in a great many cases referring
even to all the members of the tribe or clan."</p>

<p>For instance, to select a few examples from the wealth of
illustration provided by Westermarck, the "Californian Gualala
account it 'poison,' as they say, for a person to marry a
cousin or an avuncular relation, and strictly observe in
marriage the Mosaic table of prohibited affinities."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Among
the "Bogos of Eastern Africa, persons related within the
seventh degree may not intermarry, whether the relationship
be on the paternal or maternal side;" and a similar rule
exists among the Pipiles of San Salvador. "Among the
Kalmucks, no man can marry a relation on the father's side;
and so deeply rooted is this custom among them, that a Kalmuck
proverb says, 'The great folk and dogs know no relationship,'
alluding to the fact that only a prince may marry
a relative." Often clan exogamy is enforced by the severest
penalties. "The Algonquins tell of cases where men, for
breaking this rule, have been put to death by their nearest
kinsfolk."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Westermarck next takes up the origin of prohibited
degrees; and after a critical examination of the various
theories to explain it, he comes to the conclusion that in no
case observed is the prohibition of incest founded on conscious
experience of its injurious effects. It has not come
into existence as the result of observation or calculation or
through education on the part of the savage. Law and custom
might thus arise; and these may "prevent passion from
passing into action, they cannot wholly destroy its inward
power." The home is kept pure "neither by laws, nor by
customs, nor by education, but by an <em>instinct</em> which under
normal circumstances makes sexual love between the nearest
kin a psychical impossibility." But this instinct is not an
"<em>innate</em> aversion to marriage with <em>near relations</em>." It is
rather an "innate aversion to sexual intercourse between persons
living very closely together from early youth;" and
"as such persons are in most cases related, this feeling displays
itself chiefly as a horror of intercourse between near
kin." It is not "by the degrees of consanguinity, but by
the close living together that prohibitory laws against intermarriage
are determined."<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>This theory, it will be noticed, coincides with that of
Starcke in selecting local contiguity or the intimate association
of family life as the fundamental fact. It differs, however,
in several important particulars. The economic or legal
motives are not emphasized; and Westermarck's explanation
is broader than Starcke's, for he holds that the aversion
extends to sexual connections outside of regular marriage.</p>

<p>It is impossible here to do more than indicate the character
of the evidence by which Westermarck powerfully supports
his conclusion. Among the Greenlanders, for instance,
"it would be reckoned uncouth and blamable, if a lad and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
girl, who had served and been educated in one family, desired
to be married to one another." It is even "preferred that
the contracting parties should belong to different settlements."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
Among the Kandhs, according to Colonel Macpherson,
"marriage cannot take place even with strangers who
have been long adopted into, or domesticated with, a tribe;"
and the Cis-Natalian Kafirs are reputed to "dislike marriage
between persons who live very closely together, whether
related or not."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Further proof is derived from the fact
that "many peoples have a rule of exogamy, which does not
depend on kinship at all." Piedrahita, in the seventeenth
century, "relates of the Panches of Bogota that the men
and women of one town did not intermarry, as they held
themselves to be brothers and sisters, and the impediment of
kinship was sacred to them; but such was their ignorance
that, if a sister were born in a different town from her
brother, he was not prevented from marrying her."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> So
also the "Yaméos, on the river Amazon, will not suffer an
intermarriage between members of the same community 'as
being friends in blood, though no real affinity between them
can be proved;'" and the Uaupés, of the same region, "do
not often marry with relations, or even neighbours, preferring
those from a distance, or even from other tribes."<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>The great variation in the extent of prohibited degrees
found among nations is "nearly connected with their close
living together." Savage and barbarous peoples, "if they
have not remained in the most primitive social condition of
man, live, not in separate families, but in large households
or communities, all the members of which dwell in very close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
contact with each other." Such are the house-communities
of the American aborigines, found everywhere, from the
"long houses" of the Iroquois to the vast pueblos or "cities"
of Mexico and Yucatan;<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> the "joint undivided families" of
the Hindus and Southern Slavs;<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> and the <i>trevs</i> or clan
households of ancient Wales, comprising four generations
living in one inclosure, whose members are forbidden to
intermarry.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> It is significant that in all such cases we find
extended prohibitions of close intermarriage, which do not
exist "where the family lives more separately." In fact,
there is a marked tendency, amounting almost to a law, that
the larger the family or clan group, the wider is the circle
of forbidden degrees; and, on the contrary, the more isolated
and dispersed the manner of life, the greater is the liberty
of matrimonial choice.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>In the same way prohibition of marriage on the ground
of "affinity" or "spiritual relationship" may take place.
"By association of ideas" the "feeling that two persons are
intimately connected in some way" may "give rise to the
notion that marriage or intercourse between them is incestuous."
A strong argument is also derived from the "classificatory
system of consanguinity." Tylor has shown that
this system and the system of exogamy are, in most cases,
found together. They are the "two sides of one institution."<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>But a deeper and still more interesting question remains:
"How has this instinctive aversion to marriage between persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
living closely together originated?" We cannot help
feeling that through his masterly solution of this difficult
problem Westermarck has at last brought us very near to
the truth. He finds the key to it in the biological law of
similarity.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> It is demonstrated that a "certain degree of
similarity as regards the reproductive system of two individuals
is required to make their union fertile and the
progeny resulting from this union fully capable of propagation."
But the similarity must not be <em>too</em> close. A certain
amount of differentiation is requisite; but the differentiation
must not be too great.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> There must be homogeneity combined
with heterogeneity. Among domestic animals close
interbreeding, it is well known, leads to infertility and
degeneration; and Darwin's researches prove that self-fertilization
in the vegetable kingdom produces the same
results.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> There is abundant evidence tending to show that
what is true of plants and the lower animals is true also of
man. "Taking all these facts into consideration," says
Westermarck, in closing his argument, "I cannot but believe
that consanguineous marriages, in some way or other, are
more or less detrimental to the species. And here, I think,
we may find a quite sufficient explanation of the horror of
incest; not because man at an early stage recognized the
injurious influence of close intermarriage, but because the
law of natural selection must inevitably have operated.
Among the ancestors of man, as among other animals, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was no doubt a time when blood-relationship was no bar to
sexual intercourse. But variations, here as elsewhere, would
naturally present themselves; and those of our ancestors who
avoided in-and-in breeding would survive, while the others
would gradually decay and ultimately perish. Thus an
instinct would be developed which would be powerful
enough, as a rule, to prevent injurious unions. Of course
it would display itself simply as an aversion on the part of
individuals to union with others with whom they lived; but
these, as a matter of fact, would be blood-relations, so that
the result would be the survival of the fittest. Whether
man inherited the feeling from the predecessors from whom
he sprang, or whether it was developed after the evolution
of distinctly human qualities, we do not know."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>Exogamy appears, then, to be the result of natural selection,
arising "when single families united in small hordes.
It could not but grow up if the idea of union between persons
intimately associated with one another was an object of
innate repugnance." Conversely, the law of similarity
enables us to understand the coexistence of clan-exogamy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and tribal endogamy. The one springs from a horror of
sexual union between persons who are too near; the other
arises in a dislike of connection between those who are too
remote. Among primitive men, and sometimes even among
those well advanced in civilization, there exists a shrinking
from physical contact with strange races only less violent
than the aversion which the dread of incest excites. But
this prejudice yields to the sympathy produced by the
growing similarity of interests, ideas, sentiments, and general
culture among men. Sympathy, upon which affection
mainly depends, has widened the sphere of sexual selection.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>


<h3>IV. THE PROBLEM OF THE SUCCESSIVE FORMS OF THE FAMILY</h3>

<p>From the preceding analysis it will appear, we trust,
that scientific examination of the problems of kinship and
exogamy has disclosed something of the real origin of the
laws which govern human sexual relations. The searching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
criticism to which the theory of polyandry has been subjected,
in connection with the opposite custom of polygyny,
carries us still nearer the truth. For, in the light of recent
research, it does not seem entirely hopeless to discover a trace
of the actual sequence in which, according to natural law, the
general forms of marriage and the family have been evolved.</p>

<p>According to McLennan, it will be remembered, polyandry
originates in a scarcity of women due to female infanticide;
and it is a universal phase of social progress through
which transition is made from promiscuity and the system of
kinship in the female line to the paternal system and higher
types of family life. Furthermore, he seems to think, though
on this point he is not very clear,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> that polygyny may grow
out of polyandry through the practice of capturing wives.
This theory has by no means gone unchallenged.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> It has
been shown, in the first place, that the extent to which the
custom of polyandry has prevailed is greatly exaggerated.
Though it is found among various peoples in different parts
of the world, its occurrence is on the whole comparatively
rare; and the practice is much less extended than that of
polygyny. Its former existence cannot be inferred from
such customs as the niyoga and the levirate; for these are
capable of simpler explanation.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> It is highly probable, as
Starcke urges, that they are merely expedients for procuring
an heir or for conveniently regulating the succession to
property and authority,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> particularly in the joint family; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
there is no good reason to doubt that Spencer's explanation
is adequate in some cases. "Under early social systems,"
he declares, "wives, being regarded as property," are inherited
like other possessions.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The procuring of an heir
through a brother or some other third person harmonizes
with the "juridical character of fatherhood among primitive
men."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>Again, not only is the general extent of polyandry limited,
but even where it exists it is confined in almost every case
"to a very small part of the population."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> It is sometimes
restricted to the poorer classes, sometimes to the rich; and
nearly always it is found side by side with polygyny or
monogamy. There is another limitation, already noticed,
which tells very strongly against the theory of its origin in
promiscuity. Polyandry usually shows a tendency in the
direction of monogamy. Sometimes each of the husbands
lives with the wife during a certain period, while the others
are absent; or frequently, "as one, usually the first married,
wife in polygynous families is the chief wife;" so also, "one,
usually the first, husband in polyandrous families is the chief
husband." In him authority and the property are vested,
and all the children, even, are feigned to be his.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>In opposition to the theory of McLennan various explanations
of the origin of polyandry have been advanced. Spencer
regards both polygyny and polyandry as mere limitations of
promiscuity. "Promiscuity may be called indefinite polyandry
joined with indefinite polygyny; and one mode of
advance is by diminution of the indefiniteness." Polyandry,
therefore, does not originate in scarcity of women; nor can
it be due to poverty; "though poverty may, in some cases,
be the cause of its continuance and spread." It is rather
one of several independent "types of marital relations emerging
from the primitive unregulated state; and one which has
survived where competing forms, not favored by the conditions,
have failed to extinguish it."<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Hellwald holds a
similar view.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Robertson Smith traces its origin to the
practice of capturing or of purchasing wives in common by
a group of kinsmen; and in the case of purchase, poverty or
the high price of women must have exerted a favorable influence.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
Not entirely dissimilar is the view of Wake who,
rejecting the hypothesis of McLennan, believes that polyandry
can be satisfactorily explained "only as being established,
under the pressure of poverty, either independently
or as an offshoot from the phase of punaluan group marriage
in which several brothers have their wives in common."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
Starcke in like manner finds that it "is adapted in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
respect to this organization of the joint family group." In
its highest forms "it is only the eldest brother who is married,"
and "the younger ones are not husbands, but merely
specially authorized lovers. There is nothing to indicate
that the band of brothers, as such, take a wife in common;
that is, that the marriage is the act of the whole community."
Hence "polyandry belongs to the category of facts
which have to do with the ordinary family communism;"
and it does not forfeit its character of a marriage in which
the individual does not quite lose his personality in the
group.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>More satisfactory, from a scientific point of view, is the
result of Westermarck's inquiry. This is so, not only
because we feel that he is probably right in his conclusion,
but because his argument affords an excellent illustration of
the success with which the statistical method may be applied
to social questions. The way for a solution of the problem
had been prepared by McLennan and his critics. They had
established a strong probability that poverty and scarcity of
women are in some intimate way connected with polyandry.
Westermarck shows that there is, in fact, a close relation,
but that relation is a consequence of natural selection. The
ultimate causes of polyandry, he demonstrates, are identical
with the forces which have produced a numerical disparity
between the sexes.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> First of all the assumption<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> that "monogamy
is the natural form of human marriage because there
is an almost equal number of men and women," is proved to
be untenable by an appeal to the statistics of population,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
which reveal a considerable variation in the numerical proportion
of the sexes. Among many peoples the men are
greatly in majority; among others there is a corresponding
surplus of women. This disparity is in part easily explainable
by referring to the varying conditions of life among
different peoples. The "preponderance of women," for
instance, "depends to a great extent upon the higher mortality
of men" due chiefly to the "destructive influence of
war" and the other dangers and hardships to which primitive
men are exposed. On the other hand, the surplus of
men may, in some degree, be ascribed to female infanticide
and, still more, to the severe labor and harsh treatment which
usually fall to the lot of women among low races.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>But such causes are by no means entirely adequate to
account for the numerical inequality of the sexes. For, in
the second place, statistics show a considerable disparity
between them at birth. "Among some peoples more boys
are born, among others more girls; and the surplus is often
considerable." With the Todas, for instance, are found
about 100 boys to 80 girls under fourteen years of age;<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
while in Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria, the Arabias, the Holy
Land, and in various other portions of Asia, two, three, or
even four women to one man are born.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> "In Europe, the
average male births outnumber the female by about five per
cent.... But the rate varies in different countries. Thus,
in Russian Poland, only 101 boys are born to 100 girls; whilst,
in Roumania and Greece, the proportion is 111 to 100."<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point Westermarck finds it necessary to consider
the problem of the "causes which determine the sex of the
offspring." The view that sex is influenced either by the
relative or by the absolute age of the parents is untenable;<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
nor can the theory be accepted that "polygyny leads to the
birth of a greater proportion of female infants."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> The
theory of Düsing, however, must be regarded as the most
probable explanation which has yet been advanced.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> According
to him, "the characters of animals and plants which
influence the formation of sex are due to natural selection.
In every species the proportion between the sexes has a
tendency to keep constant, but the organisms are so well
adapted to the conditions of life that, under anomalous circumstances,
they produce more individuals of that sex of
which there is the greatest need. When nourishment is
abundant, strengthened reproduction is an advantage to the
species, whereas the reverse is the case when nourishment is
scarce. Hence&mdash;the power of multiplication depending
chiefly upon the number of females&mdash;organisms, when unusually
well nourished, produce comparatively more female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
offspring; in the opposite case, more male."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The observations
of Ploss<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> and others<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> appear to sustain Düsing's hypothesis.
Wherever nourishment is scarce there seems to be
a surplus of male births. Such is the case in highlands as
compared with lowlands; among the poor as compared with
the rich; in sterile regions as compared with those that are
more fertile. Furthermore, Düsing has suggested a second
cause due also to natural selection, which influences the
numerical proportion of the sexes born; and his conclusion
is confirmed by the researches of Westermarck. Mixture of
race among animals and plants appears to cause a surplus of
female births;<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> while, on the contrary, incestuous unions,
being injurious to the species, "have a tendency to produce
an excess of male offspring."<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> So, among half-breeds, the
number of girls usually predominates;<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> while among in-and-in
bred plants, animals, or men the reverse is the case.
Hence it seems probable "that the degree of differentiation
in the sexual elements of the parents exercises some influence
upon the sex of the offspring, so that, when the differentiation
is unusually great, the births are in favour of females;
when it is unusually small, in favour of males."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>Now, it is a significant fact that polyandrous peoples
show a tendency to close intermarriage among kindred;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
while polyandrous countries are notoriously poor. "The
Todas of the Neilgherry Hills," for instance, "are probably
the most in-and-in bred people of whom anything is known,"
and among them "the disproportion between male and female
births is strikingly in favour of the males." But the "coincidence
of polyandry with poverty of material resources"
cannot depend, as often asserted, "upon the intention of the
people to check an increase of population, or upon the fact
that the men are not rich enough to support or buy wives
for themselves." For only in Tibet, with her nunneries,
among such peoples, is there found a class of unmarried
women, and polyandry is often seen in rich families;
while in Ceylon "it prevails chiefly among the wealthier
classes." With pastoral and agricultural peoples poverty
would be no reason for the avoidance of individual marriage,
since women are valuable for their labor and "fully
earn their own subsistence." In some districts of the
Himalayas, we are told, "it is the poor who prefer polygamy,
on account of the value of the women as household
drudges."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly as a general result of his argument, Westermarck
concludes that there is some reason to believe that
polyandry originates in a surplus of men "due, on the one
hand, to poor conditions of life, on the other, to close inter-marrying.
As a matter of fact, the chief polyandrous peoples
either live in sterile mountain regions, or are endogamous
in a very high degree."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> It does not follow, however, that
a surplus of men will always produce polyandry, any more
than a plurality of women will always lead to polygyny.
Other conditions must be favorable. "This practice presupposes,"
for instance, "an abnormally feeble disposition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
jealousy;" and this is actually a "peculiarity of all peoples
among whom polyandry occurs."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>The evidence adduced seems conclusive that polyandry
holds a relatively unimportant place in the sociological history
of mankind. It is not of frequent occurrence; it is
usually modified in the direction of monogamy; and it always
implies a considerable progress in civilization. The case is
much the same with polygyny.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> It is not a mere limitation
of promiscuity, as some writers believe,<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> but usually makes
its appearance comparatively late in social history. It is
found side by side with polyandry and does not grow out of
it, as McLennan supposes. Finally, like polyandry, its importance
as a form of sexual relations has been greatly magnified.
True, polygyny is much more widely dispersed than
polyandry, being found perhaps among the majority of races
both in ancient and modern times.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Its rise is particularly
favored by the economic and social forces which produce the
patriarchal system.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> But, on the other hand, among many
barbarous peoples it is "almost unknown or even prohibited."
Monogamy appears to be the <em>prevailing</em> form of the family
precisely among peoples least advanced in general culture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and particularly in the economic arts.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> It is highly significant,
to take a single example, that among the Dravidian
Veddahs of Ceylon, commonly regarded as anatomically and
intellectually among the most backward races of mankind,
monogamous unions last until death dissolves them. To
those still untouched by foreign influences polyandry and
polygyny are entirely unknown. There is no prostitution.
Conjugal fidelity is remarkable. Free courtship exists.
Children are treated with kindness; and in general the Sarasin
brothers present a picture of pleasing domestic life
among this singular people.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>Where polygyny exists it is sometimes the chiefs alone
who are "permitted to have a plurality of wives." Besides,
just as in the case of polyandry, "almost everywhere it is
confined to a very small part of the people, the majority
being monogamous." It is so "among all Mohammedan
peoples, in Asia and Europe, as well as in Africa." Ninety-five
per cent. of the Mohammedans of India, for instance, are
said to be monogamists; and in Persia, it is reported, only
"two per cent. of the population enjoy the questionable
luxury of a plurality of wives." Among the American
aborigines monogamy is the rule. Although polygyny
widely exists among them, seldom are more than two wives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
found.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Indeed the numerical proportion of the sexes
throughout the world renders it impossible for polygyny to
become the general practice.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>Polygyny, like polyandry, is modified in several ways in
the direction of monogamy. Often, as in Africa<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> and
among many American peoples, a "higher position is given
to one of the wives, generally the first married." She possesses
superior authority and becomes the real mistress of the
household. Thus, according to Waitz, among the Eskimo a
second wife is seldom taken unless the first is childless; but
in polygynous families the first wife has domestic precedence.
The same is true generally of the red Indians of the north-west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
coast.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Among the Siouan tribes the bride's sisters
sometimes become subordinate wives;<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> and usually where
there are several, according to Dorsey, the first wife and the
last are "the favorites, all others being regarded as servants."<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
The principal Indians among the Brazilian Tupinambás,
says Souza, "have more than one wife, and he who has most
wives is the most honored and esteemed; but they all yield
obedience to the eldest wife and all serve her." She "has
her hammock tied up next to that of her husband, and between
the two there is always a fire burning."<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Among various
peoples it is required "that the first wife shall be of the husband's
rank, whilst the succeeding wives may be of lower
birth." Sometimes, as among the Chinese, the ancient
Hebrews, and the kings of early Egypt, the secondary wives
really hold the position of concubines.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Frequently the husband
has a favorite whom he treats especially as his wife; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
conversely, as among the Abipones,<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> he is "bound by custom
or law to cohabit with his wives in turn." Finally, it is
important to note that everywhere bigamy, or rather duogamy,
is the "most common form of polygyny, and a multitude
of wives is the luxury of a few despotic rulers or very
wealthy men."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Let us next consider the causes which favor the rise of
polygyny. It is highly probable, in countries "unaffected
by European civilization," that a surplus of women has
exerted an influence in its favor.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Thus in India polygyny is
found among peoples where there is a plurality of women,
and polyandry where the reverse is the case.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Among the
Kafirs and the aboriginal tribes of North America polygyny
usually appears only where the women outnumber the men.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
This disparity of the sexes may sometimes be due to the
ravages of war;<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> but it is more likely, as in the case of
polyandry, that it owes its origin to natural selection, abundance
of nourishment tending to produce an excess of female
births. Polygyny also arises from calculation. According
to Wake, "abundance may be said to be the chief inducement
to the practice;" and, as a matter of fact, it is usually
the wealthier persons among polygynous peoples who indulge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in the luxury of many wives.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Poverty and the approximate
equality of the sexes, Spencer holds, are the natural restrictions
of polygyny.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Again, "superior strength of body and
energy of mind, which gained certain men predominance as
warriors and chiefs, also gave them more power of securing
women; either by stealing them from other tribes or by
wresting them from men of their own tribe."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> In this way
the possession of a number of wives would become a mark
of distinction. Consequently polygyny sometimes appears as
the special privilege of the ruler or of a class; and, as
Spencer suggests, from its association with greatness it may
gain popular approbation, just as monogamy may be thought
"mean" from its association with poverty. "Even the religious
sanction is sometimes joined with the ethical sanction,"
as among the Chippewayans.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>Various other reasons for the rise and spread of polygyny
have been advanced. Among these are the motives arising
in passion, such as man's love of beauty<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and variety, and
his unwillingness to practice abstinence in certain seasons.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
More powerful than these is the "desire for offspring,
wealth, and authority." In certain stages of advancement
the more children a man has, the greater are his power and
distinction. His "fortune is increased by a multitude of
wives not only through their children, but through their
labour."<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> For this reason, in some cases where jealousy is
weak, women cling to polygyny; since by sharing the toil with
others they hope that its burden may be lessened.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Spencer
assigns another cause of the rise of polygyny which has
enabled it to hold its ground even against the superior type,
monogamy. For "under rude conditions," he believes that
"it conduces in a higher degree to social self-preservation."
The loss of population sustained by the ravages of war are
thus repaired. A bias in favor of polygyny may be founded
which will even come to be sustained by natural selection.
"In a barbarous community formed of some wifeless men,
others who have one wife each, and others who have more
than one, it must on the average happen that this last class
will be relatively superior&mdash;the stronger and more courageous
among savages, and among semi-civilized peoples the
wealthier also, who are mostly the more capable. Hence,
ordinarily, a greater number of offspring will be left by men
having natures of the kind needed. The society will be
rendered ... not only numerically stronger, but more of
its units will be efficient warriors." Furthermore, there will
be a "structural advance" as compared with lower types of
the family. Paternity is certain; and, where descent is
traced in the male line, "inheritance of power by sons
becomes possible; and, where it arises, government is better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
maintained." The family cohesion is greater; and "this definite
descent in the male line aids the development of
ancestor-worship; and so serves in another way to consolidate
society."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> For these reasons chiefly he regards
polygyny as a type of marriage higher than polyandry;
though he remarks that, "were it not for the ideas of sacredness
associated with that Hebrew history which in childhood
familiarized us with examples of polygyny, we should probably
feel as much surprise and repugnance on first reading
about it as we do on first reading about polyandry."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> But
this is too favorable an estimate of the relative social value
of polygyny. It is doubtful, to say the least, whether
morally and physically it is more favorable to the offspring
than polyandry; and it is almost certain that it is far worse
in its effects upon the home and condition of women.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> This
fact alone, when considered in all its consequences, far outweighs
the alleged relative structural advantages of polygyny,
which besides have not been conclusively established.</p>

<p>But, as a rule, neither polygyny nor polyandry is favored
by woman, in whom the passion of jealousy is very strongly
developed. "Polygyny is an offence against the feelings of
women, not only among highly civilized peoples, but even
among the rudest savages." It is a noteworthy fact that
"among monogamous savage or barbarous races the position
of women is comparatively good;"<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> while, on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
hand, polygyny is in almost every way degrading to the
female sex.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Accordingly, under influence of ideas and
sentiments favoring the freedom and dignity of woman, both
polygyny and polyandry must yield to individual marriage.
With woman in its favor monogamy could never be entirely
superseded as the type of human marriage. "Polygamy
must disappear as soon as a growing development brings into
play permanent motives and fundamental forces."<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Among
these forces is the "idea of procreative conditions" entering
into the conception of fatherhood. From this follow chastity
on the part of the wife, and consequently a limit to the
sexual liberty of the husband. Out of this also sprang
ancestor-worship, a powerful force in differentiating the
monogamic household. "Even in primitive times, the character,
or soul&mdash;the inward, mysterious being&mdash;of the father
was supposed to decide the character of the child....
The joy excited by the excellent qualities of a child was first
aroused in the breast of a primitive man when that child
owed its being to himself, and its excellence was a proof of
the excellence of its begetter, that is, of himself. I venture
to assert that even now this idea plays the strongest part in
what we call the voice of blood.... Vanity, a sentiment
which is often condemned, yet not always blameworthy, finds
sustenance in the most trivial occurrences of everyday life
from the thought, 'Here I trace myself; the child has
inherited that tendency from me.'"<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> With advancing culture
and the growth of altruism it is inevitable that monogamy
should assert its right to prevail over all other forms of the
family which have yet appeared among mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>So we come back to the starting-point. The complex
phenomena of human sexual relations have been examined
in the light of scientific criticism and recent research. The
result seems unmistakably to show that pairing has always
been the typical form of human marriage. Early monogamy
takes its rise beyond the border-line separating man
from the lower animals. But, considering the aberrations
from the type, development has been in a circle.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> At the
dawn of human history individual marriage prevails, though
the union is not always lasting. In later stages of advancement,
under the influence of property, social organization,
social distinctions, and the motives to which they gave rise,
various forms of polyandry and polygyny make their appearance,
though monogamy as the type is never superseded.
"Nothing, indeed, is more favourable to polygyny," says
Westermarck, "than social differentiation."<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> In its "highest
and regulated form," declares Morgan, "it presupposes a
considerable advance of society, together with the development
of superior and inferior classes, and of some kinds
of wealth."<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Furthermore there is direct evidence in some
cases that a transition from monogamy has actually occurred.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
At a still more advanced stage of culture, under pressure of
those influences which have led to the social elevation of
woman, polygyny yields in turn to monogamy. "When the
feelings of women are held in due respect, monogamy will
necessarily be the only recognized form of marriage. In no
way does the progress of mankind show itself more clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
than in the increased acknowledgment of women's rights,
and the causes which, at lower stages of development, may
make polygyny desired by women themselves, do not exist
in highly civilized societies. The refined feeling of love,
depending chiefly upon mutual sympathy and upon appreciation
of mental qualities, is scarcely compatible with polygynous
habits; and the passion for one has gradually become
more absorbing."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> But the later monogamy differs from
the earlier in one important characteristic. The primitive
monogamy "is not a form of marriage which can be regarded
as the expression of a marriage law; that is, it is not a form
of marriage which is striving for the mastery, and which
cannot tolerate other co-existent forms of marriage. On the
other hand the later monogamy, which arises from a distinct
condemnation of polygamy, or from a secret aversion to it,
is characterized by self-assertion, and seeks to exclude other
forms of marriage."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>For a full understanding of the evolution, which has here
been sketched in outline, there remains, however, a fact of
primary importance to which but casual reference has thus
far been made: the element of contract in the marriage
relation. This fact will receive some consideration in the
next chapter.</p>

<p>Everywhere among our ancestors, when authentic history
dawns upon the institutions of the Germanic race, marriage
is effected by means of a contract. The transaction is a
contract of sale through which for a price the bride is conveyed
by the father or guardian into the bridegroom's hand.
But, as will appear later, the element of sale is rapidly taking
on a symbolical character. The question arises in the outset
as to the antiquity of contract in marriage. Is it of comparatively
late origin, as is often assumed? Or can the
element of agreement, of consent of the parties, be traced
from the very beginning of the human family? Again,
what is the character and what the historical significance of
marriage by purchase? Is it the earliest form of matrimonial
contract, and does it constitute a universal phase of
development subsequent to that of capturing women?</p>


<h3>I. WIFE-CAPTURE AND THE SYMBOL OF RAPE<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></h3>


<p>According to McLennan, as we have already seen, capture
as a means of getting wives is a universal practice among
primitive men. It is due to polyandry occasioned by a
scarcity of women; it leads to exogamy; and it is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
superseded by contract in the form of wife-purchase.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> The
evidence of the former universality of the custom is derived
from two sources: first, the existence of actual wife-capture
among many peoples in all parts of the world; second, the
symbol of rape in the marriage ceremony or in the preliminary
act of taking the woman. The symbol, it is held, can
be accounted for only as a survival of real capture. Other
writers agree with McLennan in regarding the evidence as
conclusive. Such, in effect, is the view of Dargun, though
he admits that it cannot with absolute certainty be assumed
that capture was ever the only form of marriage recognized.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
Post, on the other hand, declares that the universality of
wife-stealing is beyond question; and he holds that it is a
natural incident of the genealogical organization of society.
It is connected in the closest manner with the exogamous
system peculiar to that organization, appearing as one of the
means by which marriage can be brought about between
members of different gentile groups. It was, in short, the
legal means of procuring a wife.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, a careful study of the facts makes it almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
certain that the significance of wife-stealing as a sociological
element has been greatly exaggerated, and its true relation
to marriage strangely misunderstood.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> It is perfectly natural
that savage or barbarous races should seize women as a part
of the ordinary spoils of war. Everything portable becomes
the prey of the victor. "The taking of women," to repeat
the forcible words of Spencer, "is manifestly but a part of
this process of spoiling the vanquished." They are "prized
as wives, as concubines, as drudges."<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, it is not difficult to collect examples of the
actual capture of women to serve as slaves, mistresses, or
wives at the pleasure of the captor. Among the aboriginal
American tribes, we are told, the practice is originally found
in its "greatest perfection."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> From Cape Horn to Hudson's
Bay women are regarded as legitimate booty. The Horse
Indians of Patagonia fight with each other, tribe against
tribe, the issues of victory in every case being the "capture
of women and the slaughter of men." The Patagonian Oens,
or Coin-men, make systematic excursions every year at the
time of the "red-leaf" to "plunder Fuegians of their women,
dogs, and arms."<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> It is even reported of the Caribs that
they depend so much upon the securing of foreign wives in
war that nowhere do the women speak the same language as
the men,<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> and a similar statement is made concerning the
Brazilian Guaycurûs<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> and some other peoples.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
North America the capturing of women for wives has nearly
disappeared.</p>

<p>The practice of capturing or forcibly abducting women,
though rare, exists among the Hottentots and elsewhere in
Africa.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> It prevails throughout all Melanesia, where abduction
is described as the "primitive means of procuring wives
or rather slaves, absolutely at the pleasure of the ravisher."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
It has existed in Tasmania, New Zealand, Samoa, New
Guinea, among the Fiji Islanders, throughout the Indian
Archipelago, and to a very limited extent in Australia.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> For
the Finnish-Ugrian and Turco-Tartaric peoples proofs of
the present or former existence of the practice have been
collected.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>There are abundant evidences of woman-capture <i>de facto</i>
among peoples of the Aryan stock. It existed among the
ancient Germans;<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> and according to Olaus Magnus, the
Scandinavian nations were continuously at war with one
another "propter raptas virgines aut arripiendas."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> The
same writer says that it "prevailed in Muscovy, Lithuania,
and Livonia;" while among the South Slavonians actual
capture "was in full force no longer ago than the beginning
of the present century."<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Such was the case in Servia, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
it was the custom either to lie in wait for a girl of a neighboring
village to bear her away as she went out for water or
to tend the flocks; or else an armed assault was made upon
her home. Murders were thus often committed; for the
attacking party were resolved to suffer themselves to be
killed rather than give up the girl, and all the inhabitants
of the girl's village took part in the fray.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> According to
Dargun, the Slavs are as conspicuous among the Aryans for
wife-capture and its survivals as are the Aryans, for the
same reason, among the great divisions of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> It is
not at all unlikely that the custom of wife-stealing existed
among the early Romans, even if the story of the Sabine
rape be dismissed as merely an ætological myth to explain
the symbol of capture in the marriage ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Without
doubt it was also common among the primitive Greeks; and
"even now, according to Sakellarios, capture of wives occasionally
occurs in Greece."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> It is found "among the aborigines
of the Deccan, and in Afghanistan;"<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> while it was
known to the ancient Hindus. The code of Manu mentions
capture as one of the eight legal forms of marriage. "The
forcible abduction from home of a maiden crying out and
weeping, after slaying and wounding her relatives and breaking
in, is called the Rāksasa form;" but this is only for the
military class.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The capture of women for wives is very prominent with
savage or barbarous peoples of the Semitic race. "At the
time of Mohammed," says Robertson Smith, "the practice
was universal" among the Arabs. "The immunity of women
in time of war which prevails in Arabia now is a modern
thing; in old warfare the procuring of captives both male
and female was a main object of every expedition, and the
Dîwân of the Hodhail poets shews us that there was a regular
slave trade in Mecca, supplied by the wars that went on
among the surrounding tribes.... Very commonly these
captives at once became the wives or mistresses of their captors&mdash;a
practice which Mohammed expressly recognized,
though he sought to modify some of its more offensive
features. Such a connection does not appear to have been,
properly speaking, concubinage." The sons of a captive
woman suffered no legal disability. "According to Arab
tradition the best and stoutest sons are born of reluctant
wives. And so Hâtim, the Taite, says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'They did not give us Taites their daughters in marriage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">but we wooed them against their will with our swords.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And with us captivity brought no abasement to them: and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">they neither toiled in making bread nor boiled the pot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'But we commingled them with our noblest women: and they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">bare us fair sons white of face [<i>i. e.</i>, of pure descent].<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'How often shalt thou see among us the son of a captive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">bride: who staunchly thrusts through heroes when he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">meets them in the fight!'"<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But nothing can exceed the brutal ferocity with which
sometimes the people of Israel supplied themselves with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
women. The Hebrew Bible contains various striking illustrations
of the practice. Contrary to law, which forbade
intermarriage with the gentiles, members of the military
class were allowed to marry foreign women taken in war.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
On one occasion the tribe of Benjamin, or rather the remnant
of it which had escaped the sword of Israel, stood in
sore need of wives; but their brethren had sworn not to give
them their daughters in marriage, nor could they legally
marry gentile women. "The difficulty of procuring wives
for Benjamin&mdash;which Israel made its <em>own</em> difficulty&mdash;was
solved by the wholesale slaughter of the inhabitants of Jabez-Gilead,
whose population yielded 400 virgins; and next by
the men of Benjamin enacting a rape of the Sabines for
themselves, each man seizing and carrying off one of the
daughters of Shiloh to be his wife, on an occasion when the
women met for a festival in certain vineyards near Bethel."<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
In this case the spoils of treachery and war were Jewish women.
At another time the alien Midianites were conquered;
and at the command of Moses the women and even the
male infants which the soldiers had spared were deliberately
slaughtered. The virgins alone, thirty-two thousand in
number, were kept alive; and these were divided among the
people precisely as was the other booty, even the priests,
apparently, receiving a share.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>It would be a very easy matter to produce further examples
of a custom which appears as a simple incident of war
and rapine at certain stages of human progress. Everywhere
among rude men we find lust and physical force triumphing
over the weakness of woman. In the successful foray or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the sack of a town she is treated merely as a part of the
prey, becoming the slave, the concubine, or even the wife of
the spoiler. "But in these brutal practices," it is patent,
"there is nothing which bears even a distant resemblance
to marriage."<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> It is highly necessary, as Letourneau
rightly insists, to distinguish sharply between rape and
the marriage institution. So-called marriage by capture,
he declares, is not a form of marriage at all; "it is merely
a manner of procuring one or several wives, whatever
the matrimonal system in use."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> As a matter of fact,
actual wife-capture usually, perhaps always, coexists with
regular forms of marriage. Thus, as we shall presently
see, it frequently makes its appearance side by side with
wife-purchase; and sometimes the transition from capture
to purchase, as a means of procuring wives, may be clearly
perceived.</p>

<p>Accordingly Letourneau is of the opinion that the name
"marriage by capture" should be reserved for legal and
pacific marriages in whose ceremony the symbol of rape
appears.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> But even this is too broad a use of the term, which
at most can strictly be applied only to the comparatively
small number of cases in which the form of capture is an
essential part of the legal ceremony. For the symbol occurs
in every shape and in every grade of significance, from the
brutal combat of the Australian savage to the harmless prank
of casting the old shoe with which among ourselves the
wedding festivities are enlivened. It exists in connection
with every phase of development, from the rudest savagery
to the most advanced type of Aryan culture; and it is found
among the same people, sometimes in various forms, side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
by side with actual capture or associated with the most refined
conception of the marriage relation.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>A very few illustrations of these curious practices, selected
from the mass of material available, must here suffice.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
Sometimes there is a pretended abduction of the bride by
the bridegroom. Among the Eskimo of Cape York, for
instance, the marriage is arranged amicably by the parents
in the infancy of the parties. Nevertheless the wedding
ceremony simulates an abduction. The bride "is obliged
by the inexorable law of custom to free herself, if possible,
by kicking and screaming with might and main, until she
is safely landed in the hut of her future lord, when she gives
up the combat very cheerfully, and takes possession of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
new abode."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> In the Ungava District the "sanction of the
parents is sometimes obtained by favor or else bought by
making certain presents of skins, furs, and other valuables."
If no parents are living, the brothers and sisters must be
favorable to the union. "When all obstacles are removed
and only the girl refuses, it is not long before she disappears
mysteriously, to remain out for two or three nights with her
best female friend, who thoroughly sympathizes with her.
They return, and before long she is abducted by her lover,
and they remain away until she proves to be thoroughly
subjected to his will."<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> In Greenland a similar practice is
found.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> It appears in some Siouan tribes.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> Among the
Canadian Indians, after a kind of civil marriage is solemnized
before the tribal chief, "the groom turns around,
makes an obeisance, takes his wife upon his back, and carries
her to his tent amid the acclamations of the spectators."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
Sometimes the affair takes on a more earnest character.
Among the Bedouins of Sinai the bridegroom seizes the
woman whom he has legally purchased, drags her into her
father's tent, lifts her violently struggling upon his camel,
holds her fast while he bears her away, and finally pulls her
forcibly into his house, though her powerful resistance may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
be the occasion of serious wounds.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Especially interesting
is the form which symbolical abduction assumes among the
Kamtchadales. There the wooer, like Jacob of old, is expected
to earn his wife by serving her parents. He takes
upon himself a good part of the domestic labor, and the
term of service sometimes lasts for a number of years.
"This is surely a singular prelude to a forcible marriage by
capture; nevertheless, when the period of novitiate has expired,
the future spouse must violently and publicly triumph
over the resistance of his betrothed. She is cuirassed with
garments, thick and superimposed, with straps and with
strings. Moreover, she is guarded and defended by the
women of her yourt. The marriage is not definitely concluded
until the bridegroom, surmounting all these obstacles,
succeeds in perpetrating upon his intended, so well protected,
a sort of outrage upon her modesty, which she ought to
confess by crying out <i>ni ni</i> in a plaintive voice. But the
women and the maidens of the guard fall upon the assailant
with loud cries and heavy blows, pulling his hair, scratching
his face, and sometimes throwing him over. Victory often
requires repeated assaults, sometimes days of combat. Only
when at last it is won and the bride yields herself is the
marriage concluded. The night is then passed in the yourt
of the wife, who is conducted to the husband's house only
on the following day."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> The sham contest takes a somewhat
different form, according to Bancroft, among the Mosquito
Indians of Central America. "At noon the villagers
proceed to the home of the bridegroom," whom they accompany
to the "house of the bride where the young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
seats himself before the closed entrance on a bundle of presents
intended for the bride. The father raps at the door
which is partly opened by an old woman who asks his business,
but the reply does not seem satisfactory, for the door
is slammed in his face." With great difficulty, and only
after entreaties, music, and presents have been tried, is the
door opened, "revealing the bride arrayed in her prettiest,
seated on a crickery, in the remotest corner. While all are
absorbed in examining the presents, the bridegroom dashes
in, shoulders the girl like a sack, and trots off for the mystic
circle," within which a hut has already been erected. This
hut he reaches, urged on by the frantic cries of the women,
before the crowd can rescue her. "The females, who cannot
pass the ring, stand outside giving vent to their despairing
shrieks, while the men squat within the circle in rows,
facing outward.... After dark the crowd proceeds with
lighted torches to the hut, which is torn down, disclosing
the married pair sitting demurely side by side. The husband
shoulders his new baggage and is escorted to his
home."<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> On the other hand, instead of abduction, the simulated
flight of the woman is of frequent occurrence. Sometimes
she seeks refuge in the house of a relative, or conceals
herself in the woods, whence she can only be brought back
with more or less violence.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> Thus in southern California,
according to Bancroft, "where an Oleepa lover wishes to
marry, he first obtains permission from the parents. The
damsel then flies and conceals herself; the lover searches
for her, and should he succeed in finding her twice out of
three times she belongs to him. Should he be unsuccessful
he waits a few weeks, and then repeats the performance. If
she again elude his search, the matter is decided against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
him."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> By the Siouan peoples elopement is "considered
undignified, and different terms are applied to a marriage
by elopement and one by parental consent."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> Nevertheless,
as among the Omahas, the custom is sanctioned. Sometimes,
according to Dawson, "a man elopes with a woman.
Her kindred have no cause for anger" if he takes her as his
wife. "Should a man get angry because his single daughter,
sister, or niece had eloped, the other Omahas would talk
about him, saying, 'that man is angry on account of the
elopement of his daughter!' They would ridicule him
for his behavior. La Flèche knew of but one case, and that
a recent one, in which a man showed anger on such an occasion.
But if the woman had been taken from her husband
by another man, her kindred had a right to be angry.
Whether the woman belongs to the same tribe or to another
the man can elope with her if she consents. The Omahas
cannot understand how marriage by capture could take place,
as the woman would be sure to alarm her people by her
cries."<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>Among the Kalmucks both abduction and pretended
flight are found. According to De Hell, among the noble
or princely class, after the bridegroom has arranged with
the father for the price of the girl, he "sets out on horseback,
accompanied by the chief nobles of the horde to which
he belongs, to carry her off." A "sham resistance is always
made by the people of her camp, in spite of which she fails
not to be borne away on a richly caparisoned horse, with
loud shouts and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feux de joie</i>."<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> A different custom is described
by Dr. Clarke. After stipulation of the price the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
"ceremony of marriage among the Kalmucks is performed
on horseback. A girl is first mounted, who rides off in full
speed. Her lover pursues: if he overtakes her, she becomes
his wife, and the marriage is consummated on the spot."
But the race sometimes has a different ending. "We were
assured," continues Clarke, "that no instance occurs of a
Kalmuck girl being thus caught, unless she have a partiality
to the pursuer. If she dislikes him she rides, to
use the language of English sportsmen, 'neck or nought,'
until she has completely effected her escape, or until her
pursuer's horse becomes exhausted, leaving her at liberty
to return, and to be afterwards chased by some more favored
admirer."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>Not less interesting than the forms of flight and abduction
is the custom of elopement, implying the connivance or
consent of the woman. In Tasmania<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> and in Australia,
especially among the Kurnai, etiquette requires that the
lover should run away with his betrothed. Contrary to the
common opinion, capture of women seldom occurs in Australia,
and then only as the result of war between hostile
tribes.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> "The young Kurnai," however, "could acquire a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
wife in one way only. He must run away with her. Native
marriages might be brought about in various ways. If the
young man was so fortunate as to have an unmarried sister,
and to have a friend who also had an unmarried sister, they
might arrange with the girls to run off together; or he
might make his arrangements with some eligible girl whom
he fancied and who fancied him; or a girl, if she fancied a
young man, might send him a secret message asking, 'Will
you find me some food?' And this was understood to be a
proposal. But in every such case it was essential to success
that the parents of the bride should be utterly ignorant of
what was about to take place. It was no use his asking for
a wife excepting under most exceptional circumstances, for
he could only acquire one in the usual manner, and that
was by running off with her."<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> According to Mr. Howitt,
marriage by elopement exists among many other Australian
tribes. It seems to be the favorite method when the parents
of the girl are opposed to the match. In that case, the girl is
sometimes severely punished; or the man is supposed to retain
her only as the result of a successful combat with her friends,
which may prove to be something more than a sham combat.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>The examples thus far presented have all been selected
from the matrimonial customs of non-Aryan peoples; but the
symbol of capture, in a great variety of forms and combinations,
may also be found in every subdivision of the Aryan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
race. It appears in the marriage ceremonies of Sparta,
Crete, and among other Hellenes.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> The nuptial celebration
of the Romans was characterized throughout by the show of
force. For this reason they hesitated to hold weddings on
religious days, lest these should be desecrated by the seeming
violence done to the bride.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> With the rising of the
evening star took place the <i>domum deductio</i>, or carrying
home, of the woman.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> The girl fled to the lap of her mother,
whence she was dragged forcibly away by the bridegroom and
his friends who rushed noisily in.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> On the way she held back,
weeping and struggling, while her attendants sang hymeneal
songs, not always the most refined in character. Thus in
his nuptial hymn Catullus has the choir of maidens exclaim:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p class="noind">At the door the bride makes a last effort to resist; but she
is lifted forcibly over the threshold, and even in the house
she is held fast by the arms, until at last she is fully initiated
into the sacred rites of the bridegroom's house.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> It is noteworthy
that the custom of dragging the bride into the
husband's house, or of lifting her over the threshold, exists
even now in many places. It appears in Africa; among the
Ests, Kalmucks, and Bedouins; the Indians of southern California,
and elsewhere in North America.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> In "China, when

<p>The symbol of capture is especially prominent in Celtic
song and custom. As in the German epics, it was not
thought unseemly for the daughter to marry the hero who
had slain her father.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> "According to tradition the Picts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
robbed the Gaels of their women, so that the latter were
compelled to intermarry with aboriginal inhabitants of the
land."<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Near the beginning of last century the following
marriage ceremony was customary in Wales: "On the morning
of the wedding day the bridegroom, accompanied by
his friends on horseback, demands the bride. Her friends,
who are likewise on horseback, give a positive refusal, upon
which a mock scuffle ensues. The bride, mounted behind
her nearest kinsman, is carried off and is pursued by the
bridegroom and his friends, with loud shouts. It is not
uncommon on such an occasion to see two or three hundred
sturdy Cambro-Britons riding at full speed, crossing and
jostling, to the no small amusement of the spectators.
When they have fatigued themselves and their horses, the
bridegroom is supposed to overtake his bride. He leads her
away in triumph, and the scene is concluded with feasting
and festivity."<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Still more real is the sham contest in Ireland.
As late as the middle of last century, in mountain
districts, the bridegroom "was compelled in honor, to run
off with his betrothed, even when there was not the least
need of it."<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> On the day of home-bringing, after the purchase-contract
had been concluded, "the bridegroom and
his friends rode out to meet the bride and her friends, at
the place where the contract was made. Being come near
each other the custom was of old to cast short darts at the
company that attended the bride, but at such distance that
seldom any hurt ensued. Yet it is not out of memory of
man that the Lord of Hoath on such an occasion lost an
eye."<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>A custom, almost identical with that last mentioned, prevails
in the Punjab;<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> and in many parts of India the sham
contest and the pretended abduction appear.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> But nowhere
are the symbols of capture found in such wonderful variety
and profusion as in Germany and Slavonic lands. The mass
of illustration presented by Dargun is almost bewildering
for its richness.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Every form and type of ceremonial capture
is there represented. Elopement, the sham combat,
abduction by an armed band, is the regular order of the
wedding day in every country of the Slavonic race. In
Germany, besides these practices, reminiscences of capture
are found in a great variety of pranks and fantastic sports.
The bride is concealed from her lover before the wedding;
or, after it takes place, she is stolen and concealed by the
young people of the village. The bridegroom is hindered
from entering the home of his intended on the wedding day;
or he finds his way barred to or from the church, and is permitted
to proceed only after paying a fine or treating the
crowd.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Sometimes, as in Sweden, the bride is stolen by
her lover and hidden away.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> In upper Bavaria, on the day
of the wedding, she clothes herself in mourning, black or
violet;<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> and the practice of covering or veiling her head is as
familiar in Germany as it was in ancient Rome.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> "To veil
the woman," <i>quên liugan</i>, is the Gothic name for marriage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in Lorraine it is called <i>Brautjagd</i>, or "bride-hunt;" while
<i>Brautlauf</i>, or "bride-race," for the entire nuptial celebration
is a common designation in German lands.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> The original
meaning of <i>Brautlauf</i> is probably revealed in the existing
custom of chasing the bride. Thus, in Altmark, after the
wedding feast, followed by a dance, a runaway match takes
place between the newly married pair. "Two lusty young
fellows take the girl between them, the bridegroom gives her
a 'start,' and the race begins. If the lover does not succeed
in overtaking her, he must look out for the gibes of the
crowd."<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>As illustration of social custom and mental attitude the
extraordinary prevalence of the so-called symbol of capture
is undoubtedly a fact of unusual interest; and it constitutes
an important chapter in the history of marriage. But it does
not follow, as a matter of course, that the symbol must
necessarily be regarded as a survival of actual capture. It is
scarcely credible that its origin can be traced to a single
source. On the contrary, it is far more likely that in different
places, or even in the same place, it takes its rise in a
variety of causes, though these may be less simple in
character. Thus, in spite of the protest of McLennan,<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> who
asserts that "no case can be cited of a primitive people
among whom the seizing of brides is rendered necessary by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
maidenly coyness," it is highly probable that the real or assumed
modesty of the woman has exerted a strong influence,
here and there, in producing the form of capture.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> Sometimes
the simpler explanation of Starcke may suffice. Ceremonial
capture, he declares, merely represents the "sorrow
of the bride on leaving her former home; her close dependance
on her family is expressed by her lamentation."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
Again the symbol may appear as the sign of the subjection
or subordination of the wife; for many of the so-called minor
survivals seem to have this end in view. In a society where
woman, on occasion, is seized in the bloody foray; where,
often, she is bought like a beast of burden; and where, generally,
she is exposed to the cruelty and brutality of her
master, it is not surprising that the token of the wife's humility
should find its way into the ceremony of marriage.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
Furthermore the suggestion of Letourneau is worthy of
special consideration. The symbol of rape, he holds, is first
of all a "mental survival;" a "tradition" of an epoch more
or less remote when violence was held in high esteem and
when it was glorious to procure slaves by force of arms. The
period of rapine may have passed away, but its spirit lingers.
Men love to figure in the ceremonial of marriage the abductions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of old, which they cannot or dare not any longer commit.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>"Connubial and formal capture," according to Crawley,
"are very widely spread, but are never survivals of real
capture." "In fact, formal capture, far from being itself a
survival, either of connubial or of actual hostile capture, is
the ceremonial mode of which connubial capture is the non-ceremonial;
each is a living reality, the one being material
and the other ideal."<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, after all is said, it seems hard to believe
that ceremonial capture does not sometimes have a more real
significance. Often it may symbolize the coyness or mark
the subjection of woman. More frequently it may stand as
a mere general reminiscence of the good old times of force
and lawlessness. Still it would be strange, indeed, if it did
not also appear as a direct survival of actual wife-capture.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
Granting this, however, the significance of capture <i>de facto</i>
remains the same. We perceive more clearly that it has
very widely prevailed; yet it must still be regarded as a mere
incident of war and pillage. It has nothing whatever to do
with the institution of marriage. It could never on any
wide scale have been the normal manner of procuring wives.
To assume that wife-stealing has been a universal phase in
the evolution of marriage is not one whit more reasonable
than to hold that robbery has been a normal stage in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
evolution of property.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> In spite of Hobbes or McLennan,
it remains to be proved that a state of chronic hostility was
ever a general phase in the history of mankind. Such a
state is inconsistent with the prevalence of the blood-feud.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
Even the rule of exogamy among primitive peoples does not
harmonize with general wife capture. For the coexistence
of clan-exogamy and tribal endogamy means, under normal
conditions, a tendency toward peace within the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
There is strong reason to believe that in every period of
social development consent and contract, in some form, have
been the cardinal elements of marriage. Captured or stolen
women have usually become slaves or concubines; and, except
in rare instances, the relatively small number of them
made wives must always have been insignificant as compared
with the number of wives obtained in other ways. Thus the
solution of the problem of so-called marriage by capture
appears to be similar to that of polygyny. The practice of
taking several wives is exceedingly common; but on close examination
we discover that polygyny is relatively unimportant,
and that it has never been able to displace monogamy
as the normal type. So it is with the practice of capturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
women for wives. However prevalent the custom, it does
not seem ever to have greatly influenced the natural laws or
modified the fundamental motives upon which marriage and
the family rest. But the value of the evidence upon which
this conclusion is based can be thoroughly appreciated only
after we have traced the origin of contract in marriage.
Let us begin with wife-purchase, especially in its relation to
the custom of capturing women.</p>


<h3>II. WIFE-PURCHASE AND ITS SURVIVAL IN THE MARRIAGE
CEREMONY</h3>

<p>It is a common opinion that marriage by purchase supersedes
wife-capture as a later and higher stage of development.
Such apparently is the view of McLennan, who regards the
purchase-contract as of late origin and as the principal means
by which the transition from the maternal to the paternal
system of kinship and to the individual family was brought
about.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> Post declares that bride-purchase is a universal
phase of development, more advanced than that of wife-capture;<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
and he agrees with McLennan in regarding it as a
mark of transition.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> A similar position is taken by Heusler,
Lippert, Kulischer, and also by Kohler;<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> while Spencer,
without asserting that either is a stage through which marriage
among all peoples has passed, thinks that purchase is
the usual substitute for violence as civilization progresses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
"We may suspect," he says, "that abduction, spite of parents,
was the primary form; that there came next the making of
compensation to escape vengeance; that this grew into the
making of presents beforehand; and that so resulted eventually
the system of purchase."<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>It requires little argument, of course, to show that robbery
<i>per se</i> is a less civilized method of acquiring property
than contract. That is as true among ourselves now as it has
ever been among savages. For particular individuals, even
for particular tribes, a transition from rape to contract, as
the result of moral development, will of course take place.
It by no means follows, however, that the one method has
succeeded the other as a general stage for all mankind, or
indeed for a single community. Even if we admit that
"barter and commerce are comparatively late inventions of
man"<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>&mdash;an assumption which, though probable, still requires
proof&mdash;rape is not the necessary alternative in getting property,
much less in getting a wife.</p>

<p>It is highly significant that wife-capture, real or pretended,
is usually found side by side with wife-purchase.
They appear together among peoples exceedingly low in the
scale of progress; while marriage by purchase very frequently
occurs among rude races where capture, unless as a mere
symbol, is not found at all. Thus in Africa purchase is very
common, and it is occasionally accompanied by actual or
pretended rape.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> So likewise real capture and wife-purchase
coexist in various parts of Europe, Asia, and America; and
wherever ceremonial capture occurs among races not far
advanced in civilization it is almost invariably combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
with marriage by purchase, or its allied forms, marriage by
serving, gift, or exchange.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>If, now, the cases in which capture and purchase appear
together be carefully examined, decisive evidence is disclosed
that the purchase contract is really the normal form of marriage,
while capture is usually, if not always, merely an
exceptional, even illegal, means of procuring a wife. It is
not surprising, for instance, that uncivilized races, with well-established
marital institutions, should occasionally steal
women from hostile tribes. Thus the Macas Indians of
Ecuador "acquire wives by purchase, if the woman belongs
to the same tribe, but otherwise by force."<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> In Australia
wives are often, perhaps usually, procured by exchange or
purchase; and a girl is generally betrothed when a child,
sometimes as soon as she is born.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Actual woman-capture
exists. But, as shown by Mr. Howitt's researches and those
of Spencer and Gillen, marriage with a captured woman is
only permitted when the captor and the captive belong to
groups which may legally intermarry. Death is sometimes
the penalty for violation of the class rules in this regard.
The result is that in Australia woman-stealing "amounts
merely to a violent extension of the marital rights over a
class in one tribe to captured members of the corresponding
class in another tribe." Furthermore, if the native songs
prove the existence of wife-stealing, they also bear witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in the most decisive manner to love and choice in Australian
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>



<p>Very often capture and purchase are found united
in such a way that they seem almost to be contending
with each other for the mastery.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> This union occurs in two
general forms: either the woman elopes or is carried off without
the guardian's consent, and a reconciliation is subsequently
effected through payment of the bride-price or the
rendering of a composition; or else the stipulation of the
price is made before the abduction. In the latter case it is
plain that we are dealing merely with ceremonial capture;
in the former case the significant fact is that we have to do
with a breach of the law.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> A price is paid for the stolen
woman because, like other property, she has an economic
value; or a penalty is rendered in order to escape the blood-feud.
Frequently, however, even when abduction occurs
without the consent or knowledge of the girl's friends, the
subsequent procedure in arranging the price or the penalty
is strictly regulated by custom; and this fact may perhaps be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
regarded as a further proof that the forms under consideration,
in special instances, represent a transition from capture
to contract. Among the Galela and Tobelorese,<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> for example,
when a man wishes a woman of a hostile tribe or family, he
causes her to be abducted, as she goes out for water or wood,
by twenty or more of his female friends, who bind her, if she
resists, and bear her away to his house. Should the relatives
of the girl attempt a rescue by force, the villagers
assemble and try to effect a reconciliation. Pending the
stipulation of the bride-money, the girl is allowed to escape
to her home, where she is carefully watched. On the third
day the friends assemble to discuss the price. If the woman
has not lived with the man, she may then refuse him; otherwise
the payment of the price is finally arranged.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> In case
of elopement it is the custom among the same people for the
lovers to fly to the forest or to take refuge in a "prahu" on
the sea, where they remain a month. On their return they
are received in the house of the girl's parents. If the lover
pays the bride-money, the woman follows him to his house;
otherwise he must remain with his wife, and the children
legally belong to the mother.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> With the Bataks of Sumatra
good form requires that the bridegroom should leave behind
a weapon, a piece of clothing, or some similar article as a
token that he has abducted the bride. Thereupon, when the
bride-money is paid the marriage is regarded as legally complete.
Should no token be left, however, the rape is illegal
and the culprit may receive punishment.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>Very naturally elopement or abduction most frequently
takes place when it is difficult or impossible to bring about
the marriage in the legal or customary way. Either the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
parties belong to groups between which <i>jus connubii</i> does
not exist; or the lover is too poor to pay the price demanded
for the bride; or else the parents refuse their consent.
Here we have an example of the operation of simple motives
with which society, at all times and in all places, has been
familiar. Such marriages, it has been pointed out, are usually
marriages of inclination at least on the side of the lover,
as opposed to the conventional marriage by purchase.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p>It appears, then, so far as present investigation enables
us to determine, that there is not sufficient evidence for
assuming that wife-capture, except in isolated cases, has
generally grown into marriage by purchase. As a rule, even
among the lowest races, foreign or warlike capture is an
exceptional method of procuring wives; while bride-stealing
at home, though the symbol may sometimes be sanctioned,
is merely looked upon as illegal or even immoral;<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> and,
therefore, with advancing civilization it yields to contract as
the highest means of effecting a marriage.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>Having now considered its relation to capture, let us next
notice the significance of wife-purchase as a social institution.</p>

<p>The custom of giving a compensation for a bride, though
not universal, exists or has existed among a vast number of
peoples in various stages of progress; and it often survives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
as a mere symbol in the marriage ceremony. Kulischer,
indeed, declares that actual wife-purchase can now be discovered
only among a few savage races.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> But this assertion
seems to be wholly inconsistent with the facts. Recent
researches, notably those of Post, Kohler, Westermarck, and
various American scholars, place it beyond question that
taking a wife, as the prosaic result of an ordinary bargain,
is a familiar institution in many parts of the world.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
Husband-purchase also appears, but examples of it are
exceedingly rare.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Several methods of buying a wife are in
use. The simplest way, says Westermarck, is "to give a
kinswoman in exchange for her." This method is found
in Sumatra;<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> and the Australian male "almost invariably
obtains his wife or wives, either as the survivor of a married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
brother, or in exchange for his sisters, or later on in life
for his daughters."<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> Much more general is the custom,
sometimes distinguished with the name of "marriage by
service," in which the bridegroom earns his bride by serving
her father. "This practice, with which Hebrew tradition<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
has familiarized us, is widely diffused among the uncivilized
races of America, Africa, Asia, and the Indian Archipelago."<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
In America, as elsewhere, the custom takes a variety of
forms. Among the Mayas the young husband is required
to build a house opposite the home of his bride and live in
it five or six years while he works for her father. If the
service is not faithfully performed, he is dismissed, and the
father-in-law gives his daughter to another.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> In Yucatan
the term of service is three or four years; and so stringent
is the requirement that it is regarded as highly unseemly to
shirk the duty.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> According to Martius, with whom Souza
mainly agrees,<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> the Brazilian native usually gains his first
wife by serving her father. For him he goes hunting and
fishing. He helps him build his hut, clear the forest, bring
wood, and make canoes, weapons, and nets. During this
period the lover continues to dwell with his own relatives,
but tarries the whole day at the house of his wished-for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
bride.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> If his suit is successful, either he may take up his
abode for a while with his wife's family, or he may at once
set up a separate hut for himself. Among the Guaycurûs
the son-in-law dwells permanently with the woman's parents,
but from the moment of the marriage they avoid speaking
with him; and this custom of "bashfulness," often
regarded as a survival of wife-capture and so indirectly of
mother-right, prevails very widely in America and in other
lands.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Service, though merely as proof of manly worth,
appears also among the Seri, "probably the most primitive
tribe in North America." The "would-be groom is required
to enter the family of the girl and demonstrate (1) his
capacity as a provider and (2) his strength of character as a
man, by a year's probation."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Among the Kenai of the far
north the lover must perform a year's service for his bride.
"The wooing is in this wise: early some morning he enters
the abode of the fair one's father, and without speaking a
word proceeds to bring water, prepare food, and to heat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
bath-room." When asked why he performs these services,
"he answers that he desires the daughter for a wife. At
the expiration of a year, without further ceremony, he takes
her home, with a gift; but if she is not well treated by her
husband, she may return to her father, and take with her
the dowry."<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> In some places the service must all be
rendered in advance; in others, the girl is received on
credit and the man serves the required term after the marriage&mdash;a
familiar example of each of these methods being
afforded by the case of Jacob and Laban's daughters.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
Moreover, as already seen, sometimes it is only the first or
chief wife who is earned by service, the later ones being
bought in exchange for property in the more usual way.</p>

<p>According to Spencer, the "obtaining of wives by services
rendered, instead of by property paid," is a "cause of
improvement in the treatment of women," and constitutes
therefore a "higher form of marriage," developing "along
with the industrial type" of society. "Obviously, a wife
long labored for is likely to be more valued than one stolen
or bought;" and the long association of the lovers during
the time of service is likely to foster more refined sentiments
than the "merely instinctive;" to imitate "something
approaching to the courtship and engagement of civilized
peoples."<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> But, on the other hand, without denying that
these results may follow, Westermarck forcibly objects that
"industrial work promotes accumulation of property, and
consequently makes it easier for the man to acquire his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
by real purchase." Serving for wives is prevalent among
such rude races as the Bushmans and Fuegians. Hence it
seems "almost probable that marriage by services is a more
archaic form than marriage by purchase; but generally they
occur simultaneously."<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>By far the most common way of purchasing a wife is by
giving property in exchange.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Usually the amount of the
price is arranged, like any other bargain, by agreement
between the interested parties; but sometimes it is established
by custom.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> Always where the contract is merely a
commercial transaction the price is in theory an equivalent
for the economic loss sustained by the family or <i>gens</i> of the
bride.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> But the amount varies in every possible way. Often
it depends upon the rank or beauty of the woman; or it may
be determined by her strength and capacity for bearing
children. It varies also with the economic condition of the
times, the wife-market depending largely upon the law of
supply and demand. In hard times, or where there is an
excess of women, wives are cheap; when times are good or
women scarce, the price rises in proportion. Among peoples
somewhat advanced in culture sentiment must, of course, be
taken into account. Where it is regarded as a disgrace to
accept a small compensation for a daughter, high prices may
lead to celibacy. Such, at the beginning of the past century,
was the case in Servia, where the bridegroom, in addition to
the purchase price, was expected to bestow liberal presents,
not only upon the bride and her mother, but also upon all
her near relatives. The presents were so expensive that
many a "poor fellow was unable to marry at all;" and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Black George in 1849 had a sumptuary law enacted restricting
the price of a girl to one ducat, and this must be paid
before the wedding.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> But the bride-price "varies most
according to the circumstances of the parties, and according
to the value set on female labour."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>Custom differs as to the time of payment. Sometimes
the full price must be given before the nuptials; often the
bride is received on credit, and the price subsequently paid
in instalments. In case of credit the wife with the children
usually remains with her father, and the husband does not
gain absolute ownership or control until the debt is paid
in full.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>Among the aborigines of America, North and South,
actual wife-purchase, both by service and by property
rendered, is exceedingly common; though in some tribes,
as in other parts of the world, the transaction takes the form
of a simple exchange of gifts or of a bestowal of presents
upon the bride's parents. The price is usually paid in
horses, but many other forms of property are employed.
Among the Kwakiutl, says Boaz, marriage "must be considered
a purchase, which is conducted on the same
principles as the purchase of a copper. But the object
bought is not only the woman, but also the right of membership
in her clan for the future children of the couple."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
For "many privileges of the clan descend only through
marriage upon the son-in-law of the possessor, who, however,
does not use them himself, but acquires them for the
use of his successor. These privileges are, of course, not
given as a present to the son-in-law, but he becomes entitled
to them by paying a certain amount of property for his wife.
The wife is given to him as a first instalment of the return
payment. The crest of the clan, its privileges, and a considerable
amount of other property besides, are given later
on, when the couple have children, and the rate of interest
is the higher the greater the number of children. For one
child 200 per cent. of interest is paid; for two or more
children 300 per cent. After this payment the marriage
is annulled, because the wife's father has redeemed his
daughter. If she continues to stay with her husband, she
does so of her own free will.... In order to avoid this
state of affairs, the husband often makes a new payment to
his father-in-law" so that he "may have a claim to his
wife."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>According to Dakota usage, either "bundles" of presents
are exchanged by the interested families, or else the young
man who wooes the maiden ties "a horse at her parents'
door." On returning, if he finds the horse still there, he
adds "another, keeping this up until" his "limit is reached."
If the horses are taken away, he then enters "the lodge and
takes his bride home." In case too high a price is demanded
the lover tries elsewhere with his horses, unless, indeed, he
entices the girl to elope with him; for "this is also recognized
as a marriage."<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> In "choosing a helpmate or helpmates
for his bed and board, the inland native" of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Columbian region "makes capacity for work the standard
of female excellence, and having made an election buys
a wife from her parents by the payment of an amount of
property, generally horses, which among the southern
nations must be equaled by the girl's parents.... To
give away a wife without a price is in the highest degree
disgraceful to her family."<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> Among the Indians of northern
California likewise "marriage is sometimes essentially a
matter of business. The young brave must not hope to win
his bride by feats of arms or softer wooing, but must buy
her of her father, like any other chattel, and pay the price
at once, or resign in favor of a richer man. The inclinations
of the girl are in nowise consulted; no matter where
her affections are placed, she goes to the highest bidder."
The social position of the bride depends upon the price she
brings; and, as a natural result of the system, the "rich old
men almost absorb the female youth and beauty of the tribe,
while the younger and poorer men must content themselves
with old and ugly wives. Hence their eagerness for that
wealth which will enable them to throw away their old wives
and buy new ones."<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> Among the California Karok, according
to Powers, "a wife is seldom purchased for less than
half a string" of dentalium shell, but "when she belongs to
an aristocratic family, is pretty, and skilful in making acorn-bread
and weaving baskets, she sometimes costs as high as
two strings."<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> According to the same authority, among the
Shastika in California a girl is bought "of her father for
shell-money or horses, ten or twelve cayuse ponies being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
paid for a maid of great attractions;"<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> and the Navajo
bridegroom of New Mexico will pay so exhorbitant a price
as twelve horses only for a bride "possessing unusual qualifications,
such as beauty, industry and skill" in her necessary
employments.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>Marriage by purchase appears also among various African
peoples.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> The bride-price is usually rendered in cattle or
goats, the amount varying greatly even in the same tribe.
From two to thirty cows will buy a wife among the Kafirs.
But, as sometimes happens, if a youth through his friends
reveals to the father a liking for his daughter, he must in
consequence pay more oxen for his bride.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> By the Zulu a
newly bought wife is regarded as an investment of capital
from which is expected a return of interest through her
labor and the children which she bears. Should he be disappointed
in his bargain, the woman becoming sick, weak,
or remaining childless, he sends her back to her father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
demands a return of the cattle.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> The Damara are so poor
"that they are often glad to take one cow for a daughter."
The rate is much higher among the Banyai. "In Uganda,
the ordinary price of a wife is either three or four bullocks,
six sewing needles, or a small box of percussion caps, but
Mr. Wilson was often offered one in exchange for a coat or
a pair of shoes."<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Very commonly in Africa wives are
pawned or even mortgaged, and they are devolved upon the
husband's heirs as a part of the inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the rude tribes of Asia and northern Europe,
more especially among those of the Turco-Tartaric race,
wife-purchase exists in its crudest form.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> The <i>kalym</i>, or
bride-price, is usually rendered in horses or cattle. The
young Kirgese, for instance, has to pay from three hundred
to one thousand head of cattle or one hundred mares for a
wife, five mares being reckoned as the equivalent of a camel.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
Ordinarily a widow depreciates in market value as compared
with a maiden;<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> but the Turcoman is more practical, knowing
the advantage of experienced service. Though generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
a young girl may be had for five camels, he is quite willing
to give fifty or even a hundred for a well-preserved widow.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
The Tartar maiden of northern Asia is sold by her parents
for such goods as pass current in exchange. She brings
usually a variable number of sheep, horses, or cattle; but
the price is also rendered in other commodities, such as
brandy, beer, or linen. The contract is arranged with the
utmost exactness between the parents. The future husband
and wife are not even informed. In theory, at least, "their
sentiments, their desires and antipathies, are not taken into
consideration." When all is carefully specified, the contract
of sale is legally completed before witnesses; but the bride
is not delivered to the bridegroom until after the ceremony
of marriage, which takes the form of symbolical capture.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
In China the harsher features of this custom are somewhat
softened. A "present is given by the father of the suitor,
the amount of which is not left to the good will of the
parties ... but is exactly stipulated for by the negotiators
of the marriage," the transaction thus differing but
little in form from an ordinary bargain, although it must not
always be regarded as an actual contract of sale, but rather
as a means of providing the wife's dower.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>In all branches of the Semitic race marriage, at some
time, has been a matter of simple sale and purchase. The
married woman, in early Arabia, was looked upon as merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a bond servant. "I charge you with your women," says the
prophet, "for they are with you as captives." Accordingly,
Robertson Smith informs us, in Arabic lexicons <i>áwânî</i>, or
"captives," is "actually used in the sense of married women
generally."<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> The <i>mahr</i>, or bride-price, was paid to the
woman's kindred. But under Islam it has become identical
with the <i>sadâc</i>, or present to the bride, the two terms being
synonymous.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> The Arabic <i>mahr</i> is the same as the Syriac
<i>mahrâ</i> and the Hebrew <i>móhar</i>; and in each case it is paid
to the damsel's father.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> In the early days of Israel, apparently,
the amount of the bride-price established was fifty
shekels of silver;<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> and Boaz actually declares that he has
purchased Ruth the Moabitess to be his wife.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> At this time,
however, the context shows that marriage among the Jews
was something more than a mere bargain, though there can
be little doubt that actual wife-purchase originally existed.
"At a later date, a girl was, until puberty, at the disposal of
her father, who could either sell her or marry her to whom
he pleased, being a Hebrew. There were, however, certain
conditions, one of which was that the purchaser could not
sell the girl to another person, and if he did not espouse her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>

curious relation to wife-capture. The legitimate wife is the
wife who is bought. At the first marriage the full <i>coibche</i>,
or bride-price, is paid to the father; at the second, the bride
receives one-third; and at each succeeding marriage a gradually
increasing portion falls to her share.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> Marriage by
abduction is illegal. In that case children begotten during
the first month belong to the wife's family, though they may
be conveyed to their father for a composition; and to such
conveyance he is legally entitled, when the abduction takes
place with the woman's consent. After the first month the
relation between husband and wife is partially legalized.
The children begotten thereafter belong to their father,
though they are really illegitimate and hence not entitled to
full rights of inheritance. Furthermore, a gift from the wife
to the husband is void. But every defect in the marriage is
at once cured by payment and acceptance of the <i>coibche</i>. In
case the price cannot be arranged the family of the wife are
entitled to damage. They may demand that another woman
be placed at their disposal for an equal term; or they may
exact a partnership share in the earnings of the abductor.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>Finally, it may be noted, that traces of wife-purchase are
found in every branch of the Germanic race. Nowhere, perhaps,
can the evolution of the marriage contract in all its
phases be studied with more satisfaction than in the history
of our own ancestors. The subject will, therefore, be further
considered in a later chapter.</p>


<h3>III. THE ANTIQUITY OF SELF-BETROTHAL OR FREE
MARRIAGE</h3>

<p>We have now traced in broad outline the extent of wife-purchase,
and studied its general character and its principal
forms. It appears essentially as a real contract of sale
between third parties. Technically, at least, the bride and
sometimes the bridegroom have nothing to do with the
transaction. We have seen incidentally that the purchase-contract
tends to become a ceremonial conveyance, and the
bride-price to disappear in the dower. This transition is a
fact of great social and legal import, and must therefore
receive further attention. But, first, another question of
interest arises: What is the place of wife-purchase in the
evolution of human sexual relations? If it was not preceded
by wife-capture as a general phase, is it the primitive
method of contracting marriage? Or, to resolve the question
into a more convenient form, what is the antiquity of
mutual agreement as the basis of matrimonial union between
a man and a woman?</p>

<p>On its face, marriage by purchase appears as an institution
which could arise only after considerable sociological
and mental progress had been made. It implies relatively
advanced ideas of property and social organization. Precisely
the same is true, in a less degree, of wife-stealing,
particularly of the systematic capture of women. It implies
for one thing an appreciation of the economic value of
woman's services which is wholly inconsistent with most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
primitive conditions. There are strong indications that in
the beginning of distinctly human history marriage arose in
the mutual consent of the parties. Nay, to discover the
prototype of the primitive matrimonial contract it may be
necessary to cross the boundary-line which separates man
from the lower animals. This fact seems to have been too
much neglected by writers on the history of marriage. Post,
indeed, throws out a significant suggestion. Among very
low races, he says, betrothal is a compact between the bride
and the bridegroom. As soon, however, as the genealogical
organization is further developed, marriage is changed from
an individual relation to a relation between families, and the
betrothal becomes a compact between the kindred groups.
With the decay of the gentile constitution marriage and
betrothal gradually become again an individual matter; so
that in this regard the lowest and the highest stages of
culture present the same phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>Here we have the general phases of evolution correctly
indicated, though the author lays too much stress on the
influence of the gentile system. But the view we have
expressed is sustained in a remarkable way by the elaborate
researches of Westermarck. In a series of chapters he has
put it almost beyond question that a wide liberty of sexual
choice on the part of the female is the rule among primitive
men as it is among the lower animals.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Everywhere, with
few exceptions, the male appears as the wooer. In the
female passion is less eager.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> She therefore requires courting,
and thus in effect she secures the chief place in the
function of sexual selection. Even in the case of the reproductive
cells of plants, where any external difference has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
been observed, "the male cell behaves actively in the union,
the female passively;" and the same law prevails among
lowly organized animals.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> In general, animals contend in
some sort of rivalry for their mates. Even the most timid
during the season of love "engage in desperate combats
with each other for the possession of the female, and she,
although comparatively passive, nevertheless often exercises
a choice, selecting one of the rivals." Fighting for mates
"occurs even among insects, and is of universal prevalence
in the order of the vertebrata."<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> This method of courtship,
not to be confused with capture, may also have prevailed
among "our primeval human ancestors," and it still exists
in many forms. Sometimes a fist-fight, a battle with clubs,
a duel with bows and arrows, or a "pulling-match" settles
the claims of rival suitors; and often, as among the North
American aborigines, the contest takes the form of "wrestling
for wives."<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p>But animals have other means of wooing their mates.
To this end the male in a much higher degree than the
female is provided with certain notes or calls, strong odors,
beautiful top-knots, fine plumes, brilliant colors, or similar
ornaments. Even with the most pugnacious species of
birds, says Darwin, "it is probable that the pairing does
not depend exclusively on the mere strength and courage
of the male; for such males are generally decorated
with various ornaments, which often become more brilliant
during the breeding season, and which are sedulously displayed
before the females. The males also endeavor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
charm their mates by love-notes, songs, and antics; and the
courtship is, in many instances, a prolonged affair. Hence
it is not probable that the females are indifferent to the
charms of the opposite sex, or that they are invariably compelled
to yield to the victorious males. It is more probable
that the females are excited, either before or after the conflict,
by certain males, and thus unconsciously prefer them."<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>
Such colors, love-songs, and ornaments belong to what Darwin
calls the "secondary sexual characters." For, in the sexual
selection, the "struggle is of two kinds; in the one it is between
the individuals of the same sex, generally the males, in
order to drive away or kill their rivals, the females remaining
passive; whilst in the other, the struggle is likewise between
the individuals of the same sex, in order to excite or charm
those of the opposite sex, generally the females, which no longer
remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners."<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
These characters, he thinks, depend upon the æsthetic sense
of the females. "Just as a man can give beauty, according
to his standard of taste, to his male poultry, or more strictly
can modify the beauty originally acquired by the parent
species, ... so it appears that female birds in a state of
nature, have by a long selection of the more attractive males,
added to their beauty or other attractive qualities."<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Brilliant
colors, for instance, have thus been acquired by birds
and insects because they are "beautiful or otherwise agreeable,
whereas the characters resulting from natural selection
have been acquired because they are useful." Hence "far
from co-operating with the process of natural selection,
sexual selection, as described by Mr. Darwin, produces effects
disadvantageous to the species;"<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> for many of the secondary
characters are a source of danger.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> But Wallace, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
well-known criticism of Darwin,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> has established a probability
that their primary purpose is not æsthetic, but utilitarian.
"The fundamental or ground colors of animals,"
he says, "are very largely protective;" and these are extended
in the line of the greatest structural and nervous
development.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> They are therefore an evidence of a surplus
of nervous energy, which is especially active at the excitable
period of courtship. So far as the female exercises a choice,
it is not because the males are beautiful, but because they
are "the most vigorous, defiant, and mettlesome." The
view of Wallace is supported in the main by that of Westermarck,
who especially emphasizes the fact that colors and
the other secondary characters are "upon the whole advantageous,
inasmuch as they make it easier for the sexes to
find each other." They exist to be <em>seen</em>. By association
of ideas it is natural that the females should find them
pleasing, for to them they are the "symbols of the most
exciting period of their lives."<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Furthermore, "the greatest
advantage is won with the least possible peril;" for "usually
they occur in males only, because of the females' greater
need of protection. They are not developed till the age of
reproduction, and they appear, in a great many species, only
during the pairing season."<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> It follows, therefore, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
sexual selection is but another aspect of natural selection,
and the secondary sexual characters are perpetuated in harmony
with the law of survival of the fittest. Whichever
view is accepted, the fact with which we are especially concerned
remains: the female exercises the function of choice.</p>

<p>Turning now to the human race, we find that the same
law prevails. Savage and barbarous men are passionately
fond of self-decoration and display. "There are peoples,"
says Westermarck, "destitute of almost everything which
we regard as necessaries of life, but there is no people
so rude as not to take pleasure in ornaments;" and he
quotes Spencer's remark that, great as is the vanity of the
civilized, it is exceeded by the vanity of the uncivilized.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
Every sort of decoration is in use. Attention is paid
especially to the arrangement of the hair. The body is
disfigured or transformed in a variety of ways. The ears,
nose, or cheeks are pierced or bored, and rings or other
ornaments inserted. The teeth are colored or otherwise
mutilated; and the body is scarred, painted, or tattooed.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
Now it is demonstrated by wide observation that the primary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
purpose of self-decoration is the stimulation of sexual
passion. In all parts of the world the desire for it "is
strongest at the beginning of the age of puberty," all such
customs "being practiced most zealously at that period of
life."<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> The "common notion that women are by nature
vainer and more addicted to dressing and decorating themselves
than men" does not hold good, at any rate for savage
and barbarous peoples. The females are, of course, often
fond of adornment, in this way trying to please or attract
their lovers. In some cases tattooing is practiced "exclusively
or predominately" by the women, and "the men
sometimes wear fewer ornaments;" but as a general rule it
is the man who shows the greater desire to beautify himself
as a means of gaining the favor of the opposite sex.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> The
woman requires to be wooed, for she is more fastidious than
man in the choice of a mate. "A Maori proverb says, 'Let
a man be ever so good-looking, he will not be much sought
after; but let a woman be ever so plain, men will still eagerly
seek after her.'"<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Besides, it is remarked that "very generally
among the lower races, the females are even more
unattractive in aspect than the males."<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> But both sexes
co-operate in the process of selection; and as social institutions
are developed man shares in it more and more. In
this way are transmitted the distinctive mental and physical
characteristics of each race which are necessary to its survival,
and upon which its standard of beauty depends.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>If the law of sexual selection has been rightly stated, it
would, indeed, be strange if women among low races should
not preserve some liberty of choice in marriage. In the
savage state, says Darwin, man keeps woman in a far more
abject position "than does the male of any other animal;"
and hence it is not surprising that "he should have gained
the power of selection."<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> But it must not be forgotten that
even the lowest races of which we have any knowledge have
advanced far beyond the primordial state of man. Darwin
himself comes to the conclusion, after examining the evidence,
that savage "women are not in quite so abject" a
condition as is commonly supposed;<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> and the facts show that
in a vast number of cases they have a decisive, though not
always a legal, voice in the choice of a husband.</p>

<p>According to Post, the right of assent is subject to the
following principal variations:<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> (1) Among a large number
of peoples the contract or betrothal is made by the parents
or relatives, no regard at all being had to the will either of
the bride or bridegroom.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Infant-marriage or betrothal, in
particular, is of frequent occurrence; and sometimes children
are promised even before they are born. Naturally
such engagements are often merely contracts of sale; but
usually they have a deeper social significance as a means of
extending and more firmly knitting the bonds of family or
gentile union. This custom implies something more than
mere brutal indifference to the wishes of the children; and,
besides, it serves the ethical purpose of restricting the sexual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
liberty of the bride.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> Such a contract is not always legally
binding upon the children, especially the bridegroom; and
when it is binding, the betrothed often disregard it, or the
bride runs away with another man.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> (2) In some cases the
consent of the bride alone is ignored;<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> (3) in others her
approval is asked <i>pro forma</i>, but refusal never occurs and
would not be tolerated;<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> (4) or the choice may, in fact, be
left to the young man and woman, while the right of
betrothal belongs to the guardian. With the Bataks of
Sumatra, for instance, vows and pledges are exchanged by
the lovers; and in case the girl is betrothed by her parents
against her will, she may run away to the giver of the love-pledge,
who is then compelled to receive her. A similar
rule prevails in Timor and among the Tscherkese of Asia
Minor.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> Sometimes (5) the young people are legally bound
to submit to the choice of the guardian only in case of the
first marriage, which, accordingly, is often dissolved after a
few years or even a few months; while the second marriage,
being usually a marriage of inclination, may long endure.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Again (6), even among such rude peoples as the Timorlaut
islanders, the consent of the betrothed is sometimes essential
to a valid marriage;<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> and still more striking are those
cases (7) in which the bride and bridegroom themselves
appear as the contracting parties, the right of assent now
belonging to the parent or guardian. The legal conditions
are thus reversed.</p>

<p>Free marriage in one or the other of these forms is very
widely diffused, though it may not always be possible to
determine the exact legal relation of the guardian and the
betrothed.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> Sometimes self-betrothal and contract by the
guardian are found side by side. Such is the case in
Rotuma; and among the Turks of middle Asia the conventional
marriage, in which the couple are contracted by their
fathers in childhood, is found in connection with natural
marriage which rests upon the vows of the betrothed.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>


<h3>IV. PRIMITIVE FREE MARRIAGE SURVIVING WITH PURCHASE,
AND THE DECAY OF THE PURCHASE-CONTRACT</h3>

<p>It is commonly assumed that where marriage by purchase
exists woman must necessarily be in an abject condition.
The "average facts," says Spencer, "show that at
first women are regarded by men simply as property, and
continue to be so regarded through several later stages:
they are valued as domestic cattle."<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> Such also is the
opinion of Letourneau, who takes a very pessimistic view of
the early condition of woman. During a long period her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
wishes in marriage were utterly ignored. The sale of
women and children for slaves or wives is the result of brute
force and the primitive despotism of man. Marriage by
purchase, he says, "implies a profound disdain of woman,
her complete assimilation to movables, to cattle, to things
in general."<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Doubtless among low races the lot of woman
is often extremely harsh and degraded. The examples
already given demonstrate that she is sometimes treated
merely as an object of sale or exchange; and where polygyny
exists wife-purchase may have a strong tendency to reduce
her to slavery.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> But a more careful examination of the
evidence proves that marriage by purchase is not inconsistent
with a high degree of matrimonial choice on the part
of the woman. As already suggested, purchase is far from
being the original method of contracting marriage. Like
the patriarchal authority in general,<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> by which the liberty
of the son as well as that of the daughter is sometimes
destroyed, it is of comparatively late origin, arising with the
institution of property and an appreciation of the economic
value of labor. "It may be said generally that in a state of
nature every grown-up individual earns his own living.
Hence there is no slavery, as there is, properly speaking, no
labour." A man then had no reason "to retain his full-grown
daughter; she might go away, and marry at her pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>In marriage by purchase there is still a chance for the
wooer; and the unwilling maiden has many an opportunity
to avoid a husband whom she does not fancy.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> Elopement
has its chief significance in this connection. Instead of
being necessarily a relic of wife-capture, it is rather the
means by which the lovers, particularly the bride, maintain
the actual right to dispose of themselves in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
Many illustrations of this fact might be presented. Among
the aborigines of North and South America, where, as we
have seen, wife-purchase and even wife-capture are common,
woman possesses a wide liberty of choice. In arctic regions
the wife sometimes runs away from the husband forced upon
her and joins her lover;<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> and in general the maiden often
thus escapes a detested suitor. Such is the case, for instance,
among the Greenlanders, Dakotas, Caribs, and Patagonians;<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
while among the Abipones, according to Dobrizhoffer, when
a man thinks fit to choose a wife, he must bargain with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
parents of the girl about the price. But "it frequently happens
that the girl rescinds what had been settled and agreed
upon ... obstinately rejecting the very mention of marriage.
Many girls, through fear of being compelled to
marry, have concealed themselves in the recesses of the
woods or lakes; seeming to dread the assaults of tigers less
than the untried nuptials. Some of them, just before they
are to be brought to the bridegroom's house, fly to the
chapel, and there, hidden behind the altar, elude the threats
and the expectation of the unwelcome" suitor.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> In exactly
the same way she gains her will in Tierra del Fuego, where
the lover serves for his bride;<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> and among the same people
"the eagerness with which the women seek for young husbands
is surprising, but even more surprising is the fact that
they nearly always attain their ends."<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> The Comanche
suitor must buy his bride of her parents; but unless she
manifests her willingness by leading his pony into the stall,
the bargain is void.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> A similar freedom in choosing her
mate is asserted by the woman of the Pueblos, Creeks,
Chippewas, and various other tribes;<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> while the existence of
real affection and true courtship is shown by the fact that
suicide sometimes happens on account of disappointed love.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Free marriage, very often in connection with wife-purchase,
prevails widely throughout the African peoples.
Accounts differ as to the Kafirs. According to Fritsch, a
woman is bought like any chattel.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> But Leslie declares
that generally the man first tries to win her consent; for it
is "a mistake to imagine that a girl is sold by her father in
the same manner, and with the same authority, with which
he would dispose of a cow."<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> On the other hand, Fritsch
shows that the heart of the Bechuana, and especially that
of the despised Bushman, "is not so full of his oxen," the
woman having some liberty of choice.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> Winwood Reade
informed Darwin, with respect to the negroes of western
Africa, that "the women, at least among the more intelligent
pagan tribes, have no difficulty in getting the husbands
whom they may desire, although it is considered unwomanly
to ask a man to marry them. They are quite capable of
falling in love, and of forming tender, passionate, and faithful
attachments."<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>Throughout all Micronesia and in many parts of Melanesia
marriage implies the consent of the betrothed. The
New Caledonian girl is thus always consulted; and, if
forced to obey her parents, she takes the first opportunity
to elope with the man of her choice.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> In the New Britain
group "after the man has worked for years to pay for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
wife, and is finally in a position to take her to his house,
she may refuse to go, and he cannot claim back from the
parents the large sums he has paid them in yams, cocoanuts,
and sugar-canes."<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Betrothal by the guardian and
self-marriage appear together in Burma. In the first case
the daughter is given by her father in return for service and
gifts. Her consent is not essential; but if she runs away
from her husband more than three times, she is free, and
her parents retain the gifts. In the second case the girl
elopes without the guardian's consent, a recognized marriage
relation being thus established, though the guardian may
reclaim the bride. Should she, however, return thrice to
her husband, she remains his legal wife.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> "Among the
Minahassers of Celebes courtship or love-making 'is always
strictly an affair of the heart and not in any way dependent
upon the consent or even wish of the parents.'"<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> The
Rejang suitor of Sumatra elopes with the girl and pays the
price afterwards; and such is often the case in Australia,
among the uncivilized tribes of India, and throughout the
Indian Archipelago. In all these cases, as well as among
some of the Turanian peoples of central and northern Asia,
the choice of the woman, even without elopement, is usually
decisive, though often the arrangement of the marriage
belongs legally to the parents.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very easy to exaggerate the bright as well as the
dark features of primitive social life. The reports of
travelers, often untrained in the interpretation of the facts
which they observe, are notoriously untrustworthy. It is
extremely difficult to discern the motives which actuate men
in a stage of culture remote from our own. Nevertheless it
seems certain that the position of uncivilized woman with
respect to marriage is not quite so hopeless as is generally
imagined. The facts appear to demonstrate that woman's
original liberty of selection has never been entirely lost. It
is evident that wife-purchase, though sometimes the means
of degradation, even of marital bondage, is compatible with
a high degree of matrimonial choice. The ideas which
influence the "uncivilized" man in selling his daughter are
probably often very similar to those which govern the
thrifty father in modern society when he insists on securing
a good "match" for his child. The price is regarded as a
fair equivalent for the services to which the parent is justly
entitled in return for rearing the girl.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> The Kafir maiden
who brings a good price from her suitor is not therefore
necessarily a "chattel" any more than is the daughter
whose labor the civilized parent lets out for hire.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> A high
price may be looked upon also as a proper recognition of the
rank or of the mental and physical attractions of the bride.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>
Furthermore, it is significant that actual bride-purchase may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
coexist with advanced ethical and religious conceptions of
the marriage state. Such, according to Kohler, is the case
in the Punjab, where the courts under British rule have
decided that the sale of a woman to be a wife is not punishable
as a crime under the statute forbidding the sale of a
human being into slavery;<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> and Leist has shown that in the
<i>dharma</i> period of early Aryan history the purchased wife
was not regarded as a "thing," but in the fullest sense as a
free wife entitled to share the <i>sacra</i> of the husband's house.
Nay, the actual payment of the legal bride-money in certain
cases was the only means through which marriage by purchase
could reach the proper ethical end of legitimate
marriage: the birth of a son to perpetuate the ancestral
worship.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p>Another fact, sometimes misinterpreted, seems to point
clearly to the persistence of original free marriage. It is
highly significant that wife-purchase appears never to have
existed at all among a certain number of very low races,
with which nevertheless marriage rests on the free consent
of the parties. Such is the case among the California Wintun,
the Alaskan Yukonikhotana, the Andamanese, the Chittagong
hill tribes, and certain African peoples. Among
the "Pádams, one of the lowest peoples of India, it is customary
for a lover to show his inclinations whilst courting
by presenting his sweetheart and her parents with small
delicacies, such as field mice and squirrels, though the parents
seldom interfere with the young couple's designs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
it would be regarded as an indelible disgrace to barter a
child's happiness for money."<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> So likewise with the Veddahs<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
either no presents are given on either side, or else the
ceremony consists simply in offering some food to the parents
of the bride; and elsewhere the proffer of similar
"wooing-gifts," without previous stipulation, must be looked
upon either as a token of good-will or as an indication of
the ability of the bridegroom to provide for a wife, rather
than as a means of purchase.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> The probational marriages
of the Seri Indians appear to have a like significance.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> May
we not go a step farther? Is it not probable that the widely
diffused custom of bestowing presents of greater value, even
where the amount is established by usage or previous agreement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
may sometimes be due to like motives? Though, as a
rule, the presentation of such gifts represents a "weakened"
form of wife-purchase, it does not seem necessary to assign
the origin of the practice to a single cause. The same is
true of the custom of exchanging presents between the two
families. Usually it is rightly explained as a stage in the
decay of purchase and in the rise of the dower; but when
we find the return of gifts in use among such rude peoples,
for instance, as the Bechuanas, the Kalmucks, the Makassars,
and the American Indians,<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> it seems reasonable to suppose
that the custom, in some cases at least, may represent a ceremonial
development of free marriage, taking its rise in various
motives. Thus among the Todas, it has been suggested,
the transaction appears as an exchange of dowers to serve as
a security for the mutual good behavior of the future couple.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
Similarly with the American Indians the gift to the bride's
parents may sometimes be designed to purchase clan privileges<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>
or to procure the "alliance of the wife's cabin;" while
the exchange of presents, which is found where it is usual
for the husband to take up his abode in the wife's home,
ought perhaps to be regarded as a matrimonial compact of
alliance between the two families.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, after every allowance is made, the custom of
purchasing wives bears the indelible stamp of barbarism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Like polygyny, which it so often accompanies, it is an offense
against the feelings and the dignity of woman. Therefore,
often at a relatively early period of social progress, it falls
into disrepute; but while it is gradually abandoned as a
thing unseemly or disgraceful, traces of it may long survive.
On the one hand, as in the case of the Roman <i>coemptio</i>, the
Hindu <i>ārsha</i>, the Anglo-Saxon <i>beweddung</i>, or the Jewish
contract with the penny, the form of sale is present in the
wedding ceremony; or, on the other hand, the bride-money,
though still rendered, comes in time to be regarded as
simply a compensation for the guardianship of the woman;<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
or else, passing through several intermediate stages, it is
slowly transformed into a dower.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>In the first stage of decline the bride-price appears as a
nominal compensation, out of proportion to the real value of
the girl. It usually consists of presents to the wife's parents
or relatives, and sometimes these are scarcely distinguishable
from the "wooing-gifts" already mentioned; while later it
may degenerate into a mere symbol or become a sportive
social observance whose meaning is entirely forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
Again, among a large number of peoples, custom requires
that a part, sometimes all, of the gifts constituting the price,
or their equivalent, shall be returned to the bridegroom or
his family; and it is significant that special care is sometimes
taken, as among the Indians of Oregon, "not to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
over the same horses or the same articles."<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> With other
peoples a part or the whole of the purchase price comes to the
bride herself. Either the father turns it over as a marriage
portion, or it is paid to her directly by the bridegroom. In
the latter case, as Westermarck observes, it is often difficult
"to make out whether the presents obtained from the bridegroom
formed originally a part of the bride-price or were
only a means of gaining her own consent."<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> One step more,
and we reach the stage of development in which the father
provides his daughters with a dotal portion out of his own
substance.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>Thus, to summarize, it appears in general that the institution
of dower takes its rise in two principal sources: either
it is derived through the return gift from its exact opposite,
the ancient purchase price of the bride; or, as a means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
providing in some way for the wife as a member of the new
household, it has developed along with free marriage, and
stands as an expression of the natural motives and desires
upon which the human family rests. Strangely enough, in
our own society the marriage portion "has become a purchase
sum by means of which a father buys a husband for
his daughter."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> It may be doubted whether the ideas which
actuate the modern plutocrat in such a transaction differ
essentially from those of the rich savage or barbarian who
succeeds in procuring a beautiful or high-born maiden in
exchange for his flocks.</p>

<p>We have now traced the evolution of the marriage contract
throughout its entire course, and are able to perceive in a
measure its true place in the general history of the human
family. Again the movement has been in a circle. As in
the case of monogamy, the genesis of contract must be
sought beyond the border-line between man and the lower
animals. In the "natural history" stage of human existence
marriage rested on the free consent of the man and the
woman. It was an informal agreement. The man was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
wooer, and to the woman belonged the first place in sexual
choice. In obedience to the unvarying requirements of
organic law, the best attributes of each race have thus been
differentiated: through natural selection they represent the
survival of the fittest. At a later stage of development the
element of mutual consent falls somewhat into abeyance.
With the rise of property, industry, and a more complex
social organization, giving birth to new desires and ambitions,
contract by the guardian in part supersedes self-betrothal.
Purchase and its occasional alternative, capture, depriving
woman of her natural right of assent, tend to reduce the
wife to concubinage and domestic slavery. But fortunately
the victory is not complete. Just as monogamy is never
displaced by polygyny as the natural type of marriage, so
the consent of woman as the normal condition of matrimonial
union is never entirely destroyed by wife-purchase.
With the evolution of altruism, the increase of culture, producing
sympathy upon which connubial love largely depends,
and the gradual recognition of the spiritual equality of the
sexes, self-betrothal, like monogamy, again predominates.
In short, whether regarded historically or biologically,
monogamy and self-betrothal appear simply as two aspects
of the same institution; they are connected by a psychic
bond, and together they constitute the highest type of marriage
and the family.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

EARLY HISTORY OF DIVORCE</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note V.</span>&mdash;For the law and custom of divorce
among uncivilized peoples the best analysis and the most painstaking
classifications are given by Post in his <cite>Entwicklungsgeschichte des
Familienrechts</cite> and the first volume of his <cite>Afrikanische Jurisprudenz</cite>,
supplemented by the more general notices contained in his various
other writings. The subject is also well treated, with the usual minute
citation of authorities, in the twenty-third chapter of Westermarck's
<cite>Human Marriage</cite>. The fourteenth chapter of Letourneau's <cite>L'évolution
du mariage et de la famille</cite> is interesting and suggestive, but his
analysis is defective; and in this connection, as elsewhere, the author is
inclined to take too pessimistic a view of the juridical character of
early society. Further general or special discussion may also be found
in many of the works already described in previous Bibliographical
Notes, especially in those of Wake, Starcke, Spencer, Mason, Unger,
Bastian, Friedrichs, Smith, Krauss, Wilken, Riedel, Henrici, Bernhöft,
Rehme, Hellwald, Klemm, Ratzel, Waitz, Fritsch, Munzinger, Sarasin,
and the numerous papers of Kohler. For the Chinese, in connection
with the books enumerated in Bibliographical Note IV, read Legge, <cite>Life
and Teachings of Confucius</cite> (3d ed., London, 1872); Doolittle, <cite>Social
Life of the Chinese</cite> (New York, 1867); and Alabaster, <cite>Chinese Criminal
Law</cite> (London, 1899). The literature relating to the Eskimo and the
red Indians of America, mentioned in Bibliographical Note IV, yields

<h3>I. THE RIGHT OF DIVORCE</h3>

<p>Few of the results of recent research are more surprising
than the revelation of the existence among low races of elaborate
systems of unwritten law covering, often in a very
orderly and comprehensive way, most of the divisions which
one ordinarily associates with "civilized" jurisprudence.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
This is especially true of the law of divorce. The investigations
of various scholars, notably those of Kohler,
Letourneau, Westermarck, and Post, have disclosed among
the barbarous or even savage races of mankind a careful
attention to detail, a stability, and often a respect for
equity, in the customary rules relating to the dissolution of
marriage, which western prejudice is scarcely prepared to
find; while other peoples commonly looked upon as civilized,
but relatively non-progressive, such as the Chinese,
are sometimes quite capable of teaching us valuable lessons
in this regard.</p>

<p>According to the generalization of Post, who has given
the most careful groupings,<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> "the laws of divorce found
among the different peoples of the earth vary within the
widest limits conceivable." So confusing, indeed, is the
mass of custom relating to the subject that in the very outset
a word of warning must be given. For in the present
state of inquiry, often dependent upon superficial observation
and conflicting reports, any analysis or classification,
however careful, must perforce be accepted as really tentative
and only in broad outline approaching the truth.
Nevertheless, with regard to the liberty of divorce, following
the suggestion of Post, five classes of peoples may be differentiated:</p>

<p>1. Very often among rude races, particularly where the
"genealogical organization is little developed or in process
of decay," the marriage bond is lax, and it is readily dissolved
at the pleasure of either party.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> Such is the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
with many African, Asiatic, American, and Oceanic peoples.
Among the African Damaras, for instance, the wife may
change her husband every week if she likes.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Similarly
among the Shekiani, another negro tribe, the woman may
abandon her spouse for mistreatment or for any other cause,
returning to her native village, where her friends make it
a point of honor not to give her back; and in this way wars
sometimes arise.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> Like freedom exists on the Gold Coast
and among the Felups of Fogni; and very commonly in
Africa the wife may leave the husband if the purchase price
is returned.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Among the Makassars and Buginese, without
assigning any cause whatever, either party may divorce the
other, dividing the children between them.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> The same is
true of the endogamic Alfurese of Minahasa, with whom the
cognatic system of relationship prevails.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> Even in Burma
divorce appears to be a one-sided matter, though the person
dissolving the marriage suffers severe disadvantages with
respect to property rights.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> In ancient Arabia marriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
were formed without ceremony, and they were ended
by either spouse with equal ease.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> But the law of the
Amaxosa, constituting with the Amazulu the division of the
Bantu stock commonly called "Kafirs," affords a particularly
interesting example of early custom with regard to
divorce and its legal consequences. Both parties enjoy the
greatest freedom in dissolving the marriage; and this is
all the more striking because of the prevalence of wife-purchase,
which usually restricts the privileges of the
woman in this regard. If the marriage is childless, however
long it may have endured, the husband who proves the
alleged ground of divorce is entitled to receive back the
purchase price; and this is true also, in case of such a marriage,
when the separation takes place on the part of the
wife, unless she establishes very grave cause for her action.
The divorced woman is permitted to marry again, provided
the purchase price is restored to the first husband; and this
in such case he is entitled to receive even when she has
borne him children: for here "in all cases the children
belong to the father."<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>Divorce is a simple matter among the Point Barrow
Eskimo. "As well as we could judge," writes Murdoch,
"the marriage bond was regarded simply as a contract ...;
and, without any formal ceremony of divorce, easily dissolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in the same way on account of incompatibility of
temper or even on account of temporary disagreements."<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>
Among the Santee Dakotas, where mother-right is said to
prevail, "a wife's mother can take her from the husband and
give her to another man." With "the Cegiha, if the husband
is kind, the mother-in-law never interferes." But
when he is "unkind the wife takes herself back, saying to
him, 'I have had you for my husband long enough; depart.'"
When the man has beaten the woman several times or been
otherwise cruel, sometimes her father or elder brother says
to him: "You have made her suffer; you shall not have her
for a wife any longer." When a woman who has been
warned against a man by her relatives repents and wishes to
dissolve the marriage, her male kindred as a punishment say
to her: "Not so; still have him for your husband; remain
with him always."<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>2. Passing to the opposite extreme, there are peoples with
whom marriage is a relation absolutely indissoluble. Sometimes
this is the case on sacramental grounds, implying
usually considerable progress in religious ideas;<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> but it is
also true of peoples standing on a very low plane of culture,
such as certain of the Papuas of New Guinea, the Veddahs<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of Ceylon, or the Niassers of Batu, where death alone is
sufficient to dissolve the marriage bond.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>3. Between these extremes of one-sided freedom and
entire prohibition of divorce various intermediate phases
appear. Sometimes the only method is mutual agreement
of the parties. So, for instance, according to Post, among
the Karo-Karo, a Batak tribe on the east coast of Sumatra,
neither harsh mistreatment, wicked desertion, nor even
adultery gives either the wife or the husband singly the
right to demand a separation. Only in case of life-assault
is one-sided divorce permitted; and this rule is perhaps a
mitigation of the older and severer law.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> In West-Victoria
"a man can divorce his wife for serious misconduct, and even
put her to death; but in every case the charge against her
must first be laid before the chiefs of his own and his wife's
tribes, and their consent to her punishment obtained. If the
wife has children, however, she cannot be divorced. Should
a betrothed woman be found after marriage to have been
unfaithful, her husband must divorce her. Her relations
then remove her and her child to her own tribe, and compel
the father of the child to marry her, unless he be a relative.
In that case she must remain unmarried. If a husband is
unfaithful, his wife cannot divorce him. She may make a
complaint to the chief, who can punish the man by sending
him away for two or three moons; and the guilty woman is
very severely punished by her relatives." But there are
other ways of dissolving a marriage; and under some conditions
the woman has a chance. Exchange of wives, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
both are childless, is "permitted only after the death of their
parents, and, of course, with the consent of the chiefs." A
couple without children may separate by mutual consent;
and "when a woman is treated with cruelty by her husband,
she may put herself under the protection of another man,
with the intention of becoming his wife. If he take upon
himself the duty of protecting her, he must challenge her
husband and defeat him in single combat in presence of the
chiefs and friends of both parties." When a "husband
knows that his wife is in love with another man, and if he
has no objection to part with her, he takes her basket to the
man's wuurn and leaves it. But as no marriage or exchange
of wives can take place without the consent of the chief,
the wife remains with her husband till the final great
meeting, when the bargain is confirmed. This amicable
separation does not create any ill feeling between the
parties, as the woman is always kind to her first husband
without causing any jealousy on the part of the second.
Such transactions, although lawful, may not be approved
of by the woman's relatives, and she is liable to be speared
by her brother."<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>Among the Marea, when husband and wife can no longer
tolerate each other, they are given a year's probation by the
"family council;" and only after the expiration of this
period does the formal divorce take place. A discontented
Marea dame of noble (patriarchal) rank may not of her own
will leave her husband; for this would offend social usage.
But a Tigrait, or woman of the servile class, may under such
circumstances abandon her spouse, provided thenceforth she
live abroad.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>4. Again it is very common among uncivilized as well
as more advanced races for a man to have absolute right of
divorce, putting away his wife when he likes, without the
assignment of any reason, or on the most frivolous grounds.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
Sometimes, even among the same peoples, the woman has a
reciprocal right, as will presently appear; but very often
divorce is the sole prerogative of the man, or else the
woman is grudgingly allowed the privilege only for the
most serious cause. The unfavorable position in which she
is thus placed is no doubt largely due to wife-capture, and
especially to wife-purchase, through which she too often
sinks to the level of a mere chattel or beast of burden. Still
even wife-purchase, as hereafter shown, may have its compensations;
for the husband cannot act too harshly without
danger of the blood-feud; and he may suffer a decided disadvantage
with respect to property by summarily dismissing
his wife. Unlimited right of divorce belongs to the man in
some parts of China,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> and with many African<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> and American<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>
tribes. "The Aleuts used to exchange their wives for
food and clothes. In Tonga a husband divorces his wife by
simply telling her to go." In "Yucatan a man might
divorce his wife for the merest trifle, even though he had
children by her."<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Among the California Yurok "divorce
is very easily accomplished at the will of the husband, the
only indispensable formality being that he must receive
back from his father-in-law the money which he paid for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
his spouse."<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> If dissatisfied with his wife, the young Gallinomero
of the same region may "strike a bargain with
another man" and sell her "for a few strings of shell-money."<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
In the so-called "straw dance" the Dakota
husband may "throw away" the wife whom he no longer
desires. He may even take several wives in order to dispose
of them in this way; thus adding to his importance
and giving evidence of his "strong heart."<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> Among the
Abipones divorces are as frequent "as changing of the dress
in Europe." If "their wives displease them, it is sufficient;
they are ordered to decamp." The husband's right is
unrestrained by the law; but, "appointing a drinking-party,
wherein the memory of injuries is refreshed in the minds of
the intoxicated guests, the relations fiercely avenge the dishonor
done to the repudiated wife."<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> The Tasmanian
husband, when dissatisfied or when a liberal offer is made,
may "transfer" his spouse like a slave; but in Luzon a
divorce is more difficult, for the wedding gifts must be
redistributed among the donors.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> With "the ancient
Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, and Germans, dislike was
regarded as a sufficient reason for divorce."<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> Such is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the case on the island of Nias;<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> while among the Galela
and Tobelorese the man may put away his wife on account
of laziness; and elsewhere he may do the same because she
is tiresome or because she lacks skill for household service.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>Under the existing law of Islâm the woman has gained a
limited right of divorce. By the form called <em>chol</em> she may
buy her release; and in this case "a restoration of the
marriage bond is impossible." Again, for certain specified
faults of the husband, she is granted a separation through
<i>fasch</i>, or judicial decree.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> On the other hand, by <i>li'an</i>, or
solemn oath before the <i>cadi</i>, a husband is able to put away
the spouse whom he believes to be unfaithful;<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> but in
general the right of the man to reject the woman without
assigning any cause whatever is absolutely unrestrained.
The great majority of divorces among Moslem peoples take
the form of <i>talâq</i>, or repudiation. It is only necessary for
the husband who is tired of his wife to say to her "<i>mutállaka</i>,"
"Thou art dismissed."<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> In harmony with the old
Arabian custom the procedure by <i>talâq</i> may consist of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
"triple declaration" or three successive divorces. After the
first pronouncement of the formula the repudiated woman
remains three months in her harem at the man's cost, and
he is at liberty to take her back if he will. Indeed, a single
tender glance or word of concession is sufficient to restore
the marriage. Should he not reclaim her until the specified
term is passed, he may then do so only in case she has not
already taken a new husband, and by paying her a "second
time the full amount of the morning-gift as stipulated at
their marriage." A second or even a third separation from
the same wife may be had by repetition of this process; but
the third declaration, unlike the other two, is irrevocable,
definitively dissolving the marriage bond.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>Among a great many peoples, even those comparatively
little advanced in general culture, the husband is permitted
to divorce his wife only for definite reasons.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> The causes of
legal divorce most constantly recurring are adultery and
sterility. In a great many cases divorce is absolutely forbidden
after a child, usually a son, is born. It should be
carefully noted that many of the alleged examples of divorce
on the ground of sterility are, strictly speaking, not divorces
at all; but rather illustrations of the so-called "proof-marriages"
so often met with in all parts of the world. Not
until the term of probation is "blessed" by the arrival of
offspring is the "marriage" in such cases regarded as complete,
though this may not always be the implied condition.
With the proof-marriages are sometimes described as identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in character the "time-marriages" found among many
peoples; but this form of union is, properly speaking,
usually a real marriage not dependent for its consummation
upon the birth of a child, being stipulated in advance for a
certain term.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> Besides the two leading grounds of divorce
already mentioned, many others, some of them trivial, are
prescribed by the laws of various peoples. Such are mistreatment,
deformity, laziness, desertion, and incompatibility
of temper. Sometimes the consent of the chief or
other public authority is requisite. So, among the Hottentots,
a man may divorce his wife only "upon shewing such
cause as shall be satisfactory to the men of the kraal where
they live;"<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> and among the aborigines of Victoria, as already
seen, a childless wife may be dismissed for serious misconduct
only when the sanction of the tribal chief is obtained.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
By Chinese law divorce <em>must</em> be granted in case of any of
the numerous impediments<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> to marriage; or when the wife
is guilty of adultery. For that offense the aggrieved husband
may kill the offending wife and her paramour, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
catch them <i>in flagrante delicto</i>. But should the woman not
be slain, she is punished, and the husband may drive her
away or even sell her as a concubine, provided he has not
pandered to the crime or does not sell her to the guilty man.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
Furthermore, a marriage may be dissolved by mutual agreement;<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>
and the husband is entitled to a divorce when the
wife strikes him, is addicted to drunkenness or opium
smoking, has been defiled before marriage, or when she
leaves his house against his will.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Besides all these grounds,
established by statute or recent usage, Confucius allows the
husband a divorce for any of seven faults of the wife: barrenness,
wantonness, inattention to parents-in-law, talkativeness,
theft, jealousy, and inveterate disease such as leprosy.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>
But these grounds will not always warrant a separation.
"They may be outweighed by particular merits of the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
or by special circumstances. If the wife has mourned three
years for the husband's parents; if the family has grown
rich during the marriage; or if the wife has no longer relatives
to receive her, then the seven assigned grounds fail,
the divorce is not only forbidden but void, and the husband
must retain his wife."<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> This is not the only wise and
righteous provision of the Chinese law, however despotic as
a rule may be the husband's power. Normally the wife
cannot sue for divorce; still practically she enjoys the right
of separation in several important contingencies. Under
judicial approval, for instance, she may release herself from
the marriage bond in case of three<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> years' desertion without
word from her husband. So likewise, when she suffers grave
insult from the husband's parents, she may return to her
own family, reclaim her dotal gift, and demand a contribution
for her support.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></p>

<p>In modern Japan divorce is regulated according to the
principles of western law; but formerly the husband's power
was governed, as in China, by the rules of Confucius.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>
Furthermore, in spirit the Aztec law of divorce bears a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
striking resemblance to that of China. Only in special
cases, not now understood, had the woman a right of separation;
and the husband could put away his wife only for
definite reasons, such as sterility and certain defects of
character, as when she proved herself careless, impatient,
lazy, or quarrelsome. Divorce, however, was discouraged;
and even when a legal reason was alleged, it could not be
effected without a judicial decree. The decree did not
declare the separation; it merely allowed the plaintiff in the
matter "to do what he should find good." Thus permission
was given for divorce; but the judge avoided pronouncing
the separation in direct words.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>5. Finally, in further illustration of the endless variety of
popular customs, it must be noted that among many peoples
the wife also has the right of divorce. Often, as already
seen, she may leave her husband at pleasure or on the
slightest pretext. It needs but a glance at the usages of
the American Indians in this regard to perceive that the lot
of the married woman among barbarous or even savage
tribes is not always so dark as it is frequently painted;<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> and
many similar proofs elsewhere exist.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> Among the inland
Columbians, according to Bancroft, "either party may dissolve

<h3>II. THE FORM OF DIVORCE</h3>

<p>The form of divorce, like the rules relating to the right
and its conditions, varies greatly among the races of mankind.
Very frequently, usually among the lowest peoples, it
takes place without any ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> Sometimes, however,
the procedure is fixed by law or custom. A symbolical act is
occasionally sufficient, as with the east African Wazaramo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
where the husband by way of divorce hands the wife a piece
of holcus reed, on receiving which she must at once leave
the house or be driven out.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> The Unyoro husband observes
a similar rite.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> It is likewise a private transaction in
Morocco, where the man rejects the woman by a bill of
divorce. The same procedure may be employed in China;
and a three-fold proclamation before witnesses is adequate
among the Somali.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> In Dawan (west Timor) it takes place
in a council composed of the relations of the man and wife,
where the cause is weighed and determined; but in this
assembly neither the chiefs nor the eldest have any voice.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>
Similar councils are common among African tribes.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> In
many instances, however, exactly the opposite rule prevails,
the decision of the "eldest," the "chiefs," or of some other
magisterial, priestly, or judicial authority being requisite
for a legal separation.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>


<h3>III. THE LEGAL EFFECTS OF DIVORCE</h3>

<p>Not less diversified are the customs governing the effects
of divorce; and here, as in the case of its varying forms and
conditions, one is almost as often surprised by the reasonableness
and stability of early institutions as he is shocked
at their harshness or injustice when regarded from the civilized
standpoint. In the disposal of the children the existing
system of kinship is very widely determinative. Among
a great many peoples, in case of separation, the children
follow the father or the mother according as mother-right or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
father-right prevails;<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> and where a mixed system, or rather
a coincidence of mother-right and paternal authority,<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> is
found, or else relationship is cognatic, they are divided
between the parents or their kindred.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> The division is
determined by a variety of rules among different peoples.
Often they are equally divided, regardless of sex.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Sometimes,
as in Bulgaria,<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Burma,<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> and among the Natchez
Indians,<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> the daughters follow the mother and the sons
remain with the father. In still other cases, as in certain
South Slavonian districts, the father takes the adult children,
while those of tender years are left in the mother's hands.
Such is the rule in Zara and in Bosnia.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> In Lika, according
to Krauss, when all the children are males, the mother
receives the minors, if the father consents; but when they are
of both sexes, the sons follow the father and the daughters
the mother. In this last case, however, the man is required
to pay the divorced woman whatever is needed to supply the
bridal outfit of the daughters when they reach marriageable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
age. When it happens at the time of separation that
all the children are grown-up daughters, they are allowed a
free choice between the parents. Should none remain with
the father, the mother and daughters are entitled to all the
property gained during marriage.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> Often in case of divorce
the children belong to the innocent party;<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> unless children
are regarded as a burden, when the opposite rule prevails;<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
or unless the system of kinship determines the disposition of
the offspring, when an equitable adjustment is otherwise
made. Thus among the African Fantis of the Gold Coast&mdash;where
by law the children belong to the mother's family&mdash;in
case of divorce through fault of the woman, the man
is entitled to a sum equal to 22s. 6d. for each child; and
when by stipulation the sons remain with the father, he is
nevertheless not permitted to sell them or put them in
pawn. If the divorced wife cannot restore to the husband
the price paid for her, the children are left with him as a
pledge for the debt until by their service they have paid it
with 50 per cent. interest. In this way, we are told, children
often become slaves for life to their own father and as such
are even transmitted to his heirs.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>Very similar in variety and character are the rules governing
the disposition of the property when a marriage is
dissolved. These are mainly dependent in each case upon
the general principles of the family law relating to property
rights.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> Sometimes, as among the South Slavonians,<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
receives back the property which he had at the time of the
marriage, while the common earnings are divided, though
not always in equal portions.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> But as the most general rule
responsibility for the divorce is of vital importance in determining
the course to be pursued. The man or the woman
who arbitrarily dissolves the marriage, or whose guilty conduct
is the cause of separation, usually suffers a decided
disadvantage. Thus the woman must restore the dotal gift
or the presents received from her husband; and the purchase
price must be repaid by herself or by her kindred. On the
other hand, the man who puts away his wife without just
cause must often forfeit all claim to restitution of the bride-money,
perhaps lose his children, and even suffer other penalties
besides, such as the payment of alimony.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p>Especially interesting among uncivilized or backward
races are the effects of divorce with respect to second marriage
or the remarriage of the parties to one another.
Everywhere, apparently, the man who puts away his wife or
has been divorced by her is allowed to contract a second
marriage immediately, or, at any rate, after a very short
interval.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> This follows almost as a matter of course where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
wife-capture or wife-purchase exists, or where polygyny
prevails.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> But with regard to the second marriage of a
divorced woman usage greatly varies. Among a number of
peoples she is free to marry again, if she likes, even when
she is responsible for the separation.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> Generally, however,
her freedom is restricted in this regard; and this is especially
apt to be the case where wife-purchase exists; for then the
legal rights of the husband in the woman are by no means
extinguished by the dissolution of marriage. Her status as
a wife must thus be distinguished from her position as
property or as the object of contract. Accordingly for this
or some other reason the woman who puts away her husband
is sometimes absolutely forbidden to form a second marriage.
Such is the case among peoples so little advanced as the
Ashantees and Hottentots; while the Banjun wife who
divorces her husband may not marry again in the same village
where she found her first spouse.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> Still more rigorous
is the rule in Samoa, where the divorced woman is forbidden
to remarry even after her husband's death.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> Between the
extremes of entire freedom and entire prohibition the remarriage
of a woman is hampered by a variety of conditions,
some simple and others severe. The Kafir woman may be
married again by her father when she has divorced her
husband with consent of the tribal chief. Sometimes the
second marriage depends on the return of the marriage-gift
or the purchase price; or the woman must wait a certain
period, as three months or a year, before contracting it.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
several instances, doubtless as the result of purchase, after
returning to her father's house she remains at her husband's
disposal until he formally sets her free; while in yet other
cases she may be reclaimed by him within a certain definite
time. So with the old Arabians the purchased wife was
looked upon as the husband's property, and hence divorce
did not release her from his claims.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> In Islam, as already
explained, where the ancient Arabian rule of triple declaration
of divorce still survives, a man who has divorced his
wife by a single or even a second declaration of the formula
"can take her again within three months without asking her
consent."<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> Among the Bedouins, in like spirit, when the
divorce takes place at the instance of the woman, the man
may refuse to repeat the formula of separation without
which she cannot contract a second marriage.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> Very frequently
the second marriage, whether of a widow or a
divorced woman, is not looked upon as so important as the
first. The wedding ceremonial and festivities are less
marked; the customary time of seclusion after the nuptials
is shorter; the bride-price is much smaller; or the wife has
a less advantageous position with respect to property.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> On
the other hand, the widow or divorced woman who will
remarry has sometimes an important compensation for the
loss of social prestige, since she may freely bestow her hand
in choosing a second mate.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps as a general rule the divorced man and woman
are as free to remarry each other as they are to contract a
second marriage with other persons;<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> but sometimes the
reunion is dependent upon the observance of special legal
formalities, or it can take place only after a fixed interval.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>
In rare instances, as among the ancient Aztecs, the remarriage
of a divorced couple is absolutely forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>


<h3>IV. FREQUENCY OF DIVORCE</h3>

<p>The laws of divorce among backward races, it is thus perceived,
are full of interest for the student of social institutions.
One comes from the study with a clearer perception of
the fact that such institutions are but the outward expression
of human life&mdash;of slow experience and experimentation; and
one gains a deeper respect for the concrete results of primitive
culture. Especially important is the relation of divorce
to the stability of society. The conservatism prevailing even
among rude peoples with respect to the liberty of divorce is
remarkable. This may be due in part to the fact that primarily
marriage does not rest so much upon the sexual instinct
as upon family needs.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> In some instances, where dissolution
of the marriage is free to either party, or where it is the
peculiar right of the man, divorce is exceedingly rare.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> The
American Indian tribes are conspicuous in this regard.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Sometimes there is a strong social sentiment against it.
Such is the case in China. Formerly among the Japanese,
like the ancient Aztecs, divorces were infrequent;<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> and among
many less advanced peoples, such as the Afghans, the Veddahs,
or even the Zulus, the sentiment of love is doubtless
a stronger check upon instability of the family than is commonly
supposed.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p>The rules governing the division of property are important
in this connection; for, as Westermarck suggests, the
selfish interests of the husband "prevent him from recklessly
repudiating his wife. In many instances divorce
implies for the man a loss of fortune."<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> In rare cases he is
obliged to provide for the wife's support even after the separation.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>
Often, as already seen, the woman receives back
her dotal gift and whatever she brought with her at the
marriage; while frequently the husband is obliged to surrender
a portion or all of the common property. Thus
"among the Karens, if a man leaves his wife, the rule is
that the house and all the property belong to her, nothing
being his but what he takes with him. Among the Manipuris,
according to Colonel Dalton, a wife who is put away
without fault on her part, takes all the personal property of
the husband, except one drinking cup and the cloth round
his loins;" and "similar rules prevail among the Galela, and
in the Marianne Group."<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The conservative influence of property is even more
marked in connection with wife-purchase&mdash;a powerful deterrent
of hasty divorce. In the case of a sale-marriage, even
in the weakened form of dower to the woman, the guilty
or responsible party usually suffers a decided disadvantage
from the separation. The man who repudiates his wife
without just cause, as already shown, may not only forfeit
his right to reclaim the bride-money, and incur other losses
on the division of the property; but often, particularly where
the maternal system of kinship prevails, he may have to surrender
his children as well; and the woman who unjustly
leaves her husband may lose all that she brought with her
into the home or compel her kindred to restore the purchase
price.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>Here also the results of the genealogical organization
must be considered. The blood-feud, paradoxical as it may
seem, often acts as a conservative power among primitive
men. The wife's kindred may protect her from the vengeance
of a brutal husband whom she has deserted; or they may
send her back when she has acted indiscreetly or when they
dread the wrath of the husband's clan. The organization
of society on the basis of kinship has another important
bearing upon the effects of divorce. It appears to be practically
a universal rule among uncivilized races that the
repudiated wife or the woman who legally puts away her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
husband shall return to her own family or clan, whose duty
it is to receive her. Accordingly, the lot even of the savage
woman has mitigating conditions not always accorded by the
laws of civilized society. "In savages," observes Mason,
"where every man and woman and child is billeted somewhere,
there is no such thing as thrusting man or woman
out into nowhere.... Should the man wish to repudiate
his wife, she cannot be sent out into the jungle or forest;
she must be returned to somebody."<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

OLD ENGLISH WIFE-PURCHASE YIELDS TO FREE
MARRIAGE</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note VI.</span>&mdash;The leading sources for this chapter
are, of course, the ancient folk-laws, drawn up after the wandering and
settlement of the Teutonic peoples. Of these the most complete and
the most primitive are the old English "codes," in Schmid's <cite>Die Gesetze
der Angelsachsen</cite> (Leipzig, 1858), until recently the best edition available;
or in Thorpe's <cite>Ancient Laws and Institutes of England</cite> (8vo, 2
vols.; folio, 1 vol.; Record Commission, London, 1840), which, though
not so well edited, has the advantage of an English version of the
Anglo-Saxon texts. But Liebermann, in <cite>Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen</cite>
(Halle, 1898-), is placing in the hands of scholars a more complete
and a thoroughly critical edition which must supersede that of Schmid.
For Germany the <i>Leges barbarorum</i> are contained in Walter's <cite>Corpus
juris germanici antiqui</cite> (3 vols.; Berlin, 1824); and in the later and
better editions of the <cite>Monumenta germaniae historica</cite>, particularly the
<cite>Leges burgundionum</cite>, edited by L. R. De Salis (4to; Hanover, 1892);
the <cite>Leges alamannorum</cite>, edited by Karl Lehmann (4to; Hanover, 1888);
and the general collection of <i>Leges</i>, edited by G. N. Pertz, H. Brunner,
R. Sohm, and Karl Zeumer (5 vols., folio; Hanover, 1835-89). These
laws are conveniently grouped according to subject by Davoud-Oghlou,
<cite>Histoire de la législation des anciens Germains</cite> (Berlin, 1845). Behrend,
<cite>Lex salica</cite> (Berlin, 1874), has a good edition of the laws of the
Salian Franks. There are some passages of fundamental interest, notably
the celebrated c. 18, in Tacitus's <cite>Germania</cite>; and an interesting
proof of the surviving symbols of wife-purchase may be found in Fredegarius,
<cite>Gregorii Turon. historia francorum epitomata</cite> (Vol. IV of
Guadet and Taranne's version of Gregory, 171-73, Paris, 1838; or in
Vol. II of Giesebrecht's translation, 273-75, Leipzig, n. d.). An old
English betrothal (<i>beweddung</i>) ritual of surpassing interest is preserved
in the collections of Liebermann, Schmid, and Thorpe referred
to; and the later development of the German betrothal ceremony is
illustrated by the curious Swabian ritual of the twelfth century, first
published by Massmann in <cite>Rheinisches Museum für Jurisprudenz</cite>,
III (281 f.), as also in his <cite>Fluchformularen</cite> (179); and later in Friedberg's
"Zur Geschichte der Eheschliessung," <cite>ZKR.</cite>, I, 369, 370; in the
same author's <cite>Eheschliessung</cite> (26, 27); and in Sohm's <cite>Eheschliessung</cite>

<p>The modern literature of early German and old English marriage
is already very large. Among the more important writings of the
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries are Gundling, <cite>De emptione
uxorum, dote et morgengaba</cite> (Leipzig, 1731); Ayrer, <cite>Dissertatio de jure
connubiorum apud veteres germanos</cite> (Göttingen, 1738); Hofmann,
<cite>Handbuch des deutschen Eherechts</cite> (Jena, 1789); Böhmer, <cite>Ueber die
Ehegesetze im Zeitalter Karl des Grossen und seiner nächsten Regierungsnachfolger</cite>
(Göttingen, 1826-27); Liebetrut, <cite>Die Ehe nach ihrer
geschichtlichen Entwickelung</cite> (Berlin, 1834); Bosse, <cite>Das Familienwesen,
oder Forschungen über seine Natur, Geschichte und Rechtsverhältnisse</cite>
(1835); Richecour, <cite>Essai sur l'histoire et la législation
des formes requises pour la validité du mariage</cite> (Paris, 1856);
Smith, "De la famille chez les Burgondes," in <cite>Mémoires lus à la Sorbonne</cite>
(1864); and Eckhardt, "Das Witthum oder Dotalitium und Vidualitium
in ihrer historischen Entwickelung," in <cite>Zeitschrift für
deutsches Recht</cite>, X (437 ff.). But in the literature of recent years of
first-rate importance is Sohm's <cite>Das Recht der Eheschliessung</cite> (Weimar,
1875), perhaps the most acute and able monograph ever written on the
subject; supplemented by his <cite>Trauung und Verlobung</cite> (Weimar, 1876).
The best extended treatise on the history of the marriage form or contract
is Friedberg's <cite>Das Recht der Eheschliessung</cite> (Leipzig, 1865). This
was preceded by his "Zur Geschichte der Eheschliessung," in <cite>ZKR.</cite>, I,
362-91; III, 147-86 (Berlin and Tübingen, 1861-63); and followed, in his
controversy with Sohm on the character of the betrothal, by his <cite>Verlobung
und Trauung</cite> (Leipzig, 1876). The Theories of Sohm and others
are examined by Habicht, <cite>Altdeutsche Verlobung</cite> (Jena, 1879); and,
from the standpoint of northern custom, by Lehmann, <cite>Verlobung und
Hochzeit</cite> (Munich, 1882); and Beauchet, <cite>Mariage dans le droit islandais
du moyen age</cite> (Paris, 1887). In this connection may be read
Schroeder, <cite>Geschichte des ehelichen Güterrechts in Deutschland</cite> (Stettin,
1863-74); his <cite>Rechtsgeschichte</cite> (2d ed., Leipzig, 1894); as also Brunner's
very able <cite>Rechtsgeschichte</cite> (Leipzig, 1887); Ficker, <cite>Untersuchungen

Klein, <cite>Das Eheverlöbniss</cite> (Strassburg, 1881); and Galy, <cite>La famille à

should be consulted Grimm's <cite>Rechtsalterthümer</cite> (Göttingen, 1854); the
great work of Weinhold, <cite>Die deutschen Frauen</cite> (Vienna, 1882); which
may be read in connection with his <cite>Altnordisches Leben</cite> (Berlin, 1856).
To supplement Weinhold's works for the more general culture-history
of woman in the German family may be consulted Dahn, "Das Weib in
altgerm. Recht und Leben," in his <cite>Bausteine</cite>, VI (Berlin, 1884); Rullkoetter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>

<p>Further illustrations of domestic and social life are afforded by the
literature of "left-hand" marriages. Thus Klein's short dissertation,
entitled <cite>Beiträge zur Lehre von der morganatischen Ehe</cite> (Erlangen,
1897), traces the practice back to ancient Frankish law. See also Culmann,
<cite>Morganatische Ehe und Ursprung des Feudalismus</cite> (Strassburg,
1880); Zetzkius, <cite>De matrimonio ad morganaticam contracto, vulgo: von
Vermählung zur linken Hand</cite> (Regiomonti, 1692); the anonymous
<cite>Geschichte morganatischer und legitimirter Fürsten- und Grafen-Ehen
in Deutschland</cite> (Halle, 1874), which gives a chronological account, century
by century, of particular "left-hand" marriages; and the dissertations
of Linckens, Riccius, and Höltzl von Sternstein.</p>

<p>Besides the controversial literature relating to the so-called <i>droit
de seigneur</i> in feudal times, already cited in Bibliographical Note II,
there has been collected a mass of custom and folk-lore concerning
the alleged traces of wife-purchase and wife-capture, and similar
matters, much of which will carry the reader beyond the period of the
present chapter, but which may serve to complete the picture of
mediæval private life. In this connection may be noted Wackernagel,

<p>On the controversy as to the meaning of <i>mund</i> and its place in
the purchase contract, in connection with the views of Sohm, Dahn,
Brunner, Lehmann, Schroeder, and others, see Waitz, "Ueber die
Bedeutung des Mundium im deutschen Recht," in <cite>Sitzungsberichte der
preuss. Akad.</cite>, 1886; and Kohler, "Die Ehe mit und ohne Mundium,"

by Dargun, <cite>Mutterrecht und Raubehe</cite> (Breslau, 1883); Kraut, <cite>Vormundschaft</cite>
(Göttingen, 1835-59); and by Rive in his excellent <cite>Vormundschaft
im Rechte der Germanen</cite> (Braunschweig, 1862). Scheurl's
<cite>Das gemeine deutsche Eherecht</cite> (Erlangen, 1882), though relating
mainly to a later period, is of use for this chapter; as are also Königswarter,

<p>The strong tendency of Roman legislation of the lower (Christian)
empire to re-establish the family authority and place the wife in subjection
is ably discussed by Meynial, "Le mariage après les invasions,"
in <cite>Nouv. rev. hist. de droit</cite>, XX, 514-31, 737-62; XXI, 117-48 (Paris,
1896-97); with this may be read Zoepfl, <cite>De tutela mulierum germanic</cite>.
(Heidelberg, 1828); and Stobbe, "Die Aufhebung der väterlichen
Gewalt nach dem Recht des Mittelalters," in his <cite>Beiträge</cite> (Braunschweig,
1865). Koehne has investigated "Die geschlechtsverbindung
der Unfreien im französischen Recht," in Gierke's <cite>Untersuchungen</cite>,
XXII (Breslau, 1888); and the matrimonial relations of the servile
classes are also treated by Jastrow, <cite>Zur strafrechtlichen Stellung der

<p>For Anglo-Saxon marriage the best monograph is Young's "Anglo-Saxon

are Amira's <cite>Erbenfolge und Verwandtschafts-Gliederung nach den altniederdeutschen
Rechten</cite> (Munich, 1874); and Ashworth, <cite>Das Witthum
(Dower) im englischen Recht</cite> (Frankfort, 1898). Opet, "Die
erbrechtliche Stellung der Weiber in der Zeit der Volksrechte," in
Gierke's <cite>Untersuchungen</cite>, XXV (Breslau, 1888), strongly combats the
commonly accepted theory that the Anglo-Saxon woman was neglected
in the law of inheritance; in this agreeing with Turner, <cite>History of the
Manners, Landed Property, &amp;c., of the Anglo-Saxons</cite> (1805); and
criticising Glasson, <cite>Droit de succession</cite> (Paris, 1886), which may be
read with his <cite>La famille et la propriété chez les Germains</cite> (Orleans,
1885). Henry Adams in <cite>Historical Essays</cite> (New York, 1891) likewise
takes a very favorable view of the legal condition of the early German
married woman. Roeder, <cite>Die Familie bei den Angelsachsen</cite> (Halle,
1899), has made good use of literary sources. Pollock and Maitland,
<cite>History of English Law</cite> (Cambridge, 1895), give a clear and concise
sketch of old English matrimonial custom; and there is an excellent
article by Florence Buckstaff in the <cite>Annals of the American Academy</cite>,

<h3>I. THE PRIMITIVE REAL CONTRACT OF SALE AND ITS
MODIFICATIONS</h3>

<p>It is not improbable, as already explained, that wife-capture
may have existed among our ancestors,<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> though some
of the evidence for its survival collected from the folk-laws
by Dargun and others may perhaps more rationally be
regarded merely as proof of the brutality and lawlessness incident
to the transitional period of the "barbarian invasion."<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>
The testimony of the law-books, however, points more clearly
to the former existence of wife-purchase. With the Old
English, as well as among the other Teutonic peoples, at the
dawn of history marriage was a private transaction, taking
the form of a sale of the bride by the father or other legal
guardian to the bridegroom. The procedure consisted of
two parts. First was the <i>beweddung</i>, or betrothal; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
second, the <i>gifta</i>, or actual tradition of the bride at the nuptials.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>
The <i>beweddung</i> was a "real contract of sale,"<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> essential
to which was one-sided performance; that is, payment
by the bridegroom of the <i>weotuma</i> or <i>Witthum</i>, the price of
the bride.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> In ancient times the person of the woman was
doubtless the object of purchase; and within the historical
period woman, among most Teutonic peoples, remained in
perpetual tutelage.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> When the guardianship of the father or
other male relative, as representative of the clan-group or
<i>Sippe</i>, ended, that of the husband began. But, however hard
may have been the lot of the married woman, manifestly her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
condition was very different from that of a chattel. This fact
is not wholly inconsistent with wife-purchase; for, as already
seen, a certain liberty, even of choice, may be enjoyed by
the woman where she is legally the object of sale. It has
given rise to a theory of the betrothal which it is thought
the records sustain. The <i>weotuma</i>, it is contended, must be
looked upon as the price of the <i>mund</i>, or protectorship over
the woman, which is transferred from the father or legal guardian
to the husband. This is the view now perhaps most generally
accepted, but it has by no means gone unchallenged.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Ethically and historically, as suggested in the preceding
chapter, the rise of a legal distinction between the purchase
of property in the wife and the acquirement of authority
over her is highly important. But, practically, when the
powers of the husband are so great as they were among our
ancestors, there can be little difference in popular conception
between possession of the <i>mund</i> and ownership of the
woman.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> As a matter of fact, the old English laws speak
bluntly of "buying a maid;"<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> and in Germany "to buy a
wife" was a familiar phrase for marriage throughout the
Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

<p>Whatever its essential character, there is abundant evidence
of the widespread existence of sale-marriage among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the Teutonic nations. Tacitus, who was struck by a custom
so much at variance with the Roman practice of his day, has
given in the eighteenth chapter of the <i>Germania</i> the earliest
description of a <i>beweddung</i>. "The wife," he says, "does not
offer a <i>dos</i> to the husband, but the husband offers one to the
wife. Parents and relatives are present; they approve the
gifts, not seeking those trifles which are pleasing to women,
nor those with which a newly wedded bride is adorned; but
oxen, a bridled horse, and a shield with sword and spear.
For these gifts the wife is obtained, and she, in turn, brings
something of arms to her husband. These they regard as
the highest bond, the most mysterious sacra, the gods of
marriage."<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> In this passage the essential character of the
<i>weotuma</i>, that is the gifts, is clearly recognized; and though
the historian represents it as being paid to the bride, it is
probable that in this particular he is mistaken, and that, in
accordance with the early practice, it was really paid to the
guardian,<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> for it is very unlikely that the stage of the dower
had already been reached.</p>

<p>In the earliest English codes the contract is found in its
rudest form. Besides <i>weotuma</i>, various other terms appear
for the bride-money. Such are <i>gyft</i>, <i>feoh</i>, <i>pretium</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<i>pecunia pro puella data</i>.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> According to a provision of
Æthelberht, already referred to, "If a man buy a maiden
with cattle (<i>ceapi</i>) let the bargain stand, if it be without
guile; but if there be guile, let him bring her home again,
and let his property be restored to him."<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> Another law of
the same king declares: "If a man carry off a maiden by
force, let him pay fifty shillings to the owner, and afterwards
buy of the owner the latter's consent [to the marriage]. If
she be betrothed to another man in money (sceat), let him
make bot [to this bridegroom] with twenty shillings."<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>Still, it will not be wise to accept too literally the apparent
statements of the early codes relative to the marriage
relation, for they are often brief and obscure, devoid of
qualifying terms, and must be construed in the light of other
facts. Thus Opet's researches seem to show clearly that in
the historical period women were not so much neglected in
the ancient law of inheritance as has usually been supposed.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>
<p>Similar evidences of the sale-marriage are afforded by the
South German folk-laws.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Among the Salian Franks the
bride-price appears in form of the <i>arrha</i>, to be described
presently, through the payment to the guardian by the bridegroom
of the "golden shilling and the silver penny." In
this form the <i>arrha</i> was paid by the representatives of
Chlodwig, the Frankish king, at his betrothal with Chlotilde,
sister and ward of Gundobad, king of the Burgundians.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>
Faint traces of wife-purchase survive in the Bavarian<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> and
Alamannian codes;<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> while in the <i>lex saxonum</i> marriage is
simply described as <i>uxorem emere</i>, or "buying a wife."<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> The
sale-contract retains much of its primitive character, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of ecclesiastical influences, in the West Gothic, Burgundian,
and Lombard codes. Among the West Goths the betrothal
was almost as binding as a marriage. The father or other
legal protector might contract his daughter or ward against
her will. If she disregards such a contract and marries
another man, both bride and bridegroom are "handed over
to the power" of him to whom she was betrothed by her
father or guardian, "and any relatives abetting the marriage
shall pay a penalty of gold."<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> The provisions of the other
two codes last mentioned are conceived in a similar spirit.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
Moreover, even in the customs of the Scandinavian North
forms and phrases have survived which seem to point unmistakably
to the former existence of wife-purchase.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>During the period of the law-books, both in England
and on the continent, the amount of the bride-money was
generally fixed by custom or by statute. The price established
seems usually to have equaled the value of the <i>mund</i>
or that of the <i>wergeld</i>, which depended upon the rank of the
woman.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> While the law thus fixed the amount of the bride-money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
doubtless to facilitate an easy settlement of those
cases in which marriages were illegally formed without payment
of the <i>weotuma</i>, it by no means follows, as sometimes
assumed, that its value was not ordinarily arranged by private
agreement, as in the early period.</p>

<p>At a very early day it became customary&mdash;instead of the
<i>weotuma</i> to pay to the guardian a small sum at the betrothal,
called in general <i>arrha</i><a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>&mdash;the <i>Hand-geld</i> of the German
writers&mdash;accompanied by promises and sureties for the payment
of the price of the bride at the <i>gifta</i>, or nuptials.
Strictly speaking, the <i>arrha</i> was neither a part payment nor
even a symbolical payment of the <i>weotuma</i>; it was an act by
which the real obligation implied by the contract of sale was
engendered.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> The practice of paying the <i>arrha</i> instead of
the bride-money at the betrothal led to a change in the
character of the marriage contract. "In the time of the
folk-laws&mdash;from the sixth to the ninth century&mdash;we see
among all the German tribes a change take place: the witthum,
that is the purchase price, is no longer paid to the
guardian, that is the seller, but to the bride herself; so that
the right of the guardian was practically limited to the
receipt of the handgeld, that is to a merely formal fulfilment."<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>
Thus, since the property of the wife was subject
to the husband's control during his lifetime, the <i>weotuma</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
was really transformed into a provision for the widow,
payable only after death from the husband's goods.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> The
<i>beweddung</i> was still a "real contract," but not a "contract
of sale."<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></p>

<p>In this second stage, it has been thought, was the form
of betrothal among the old English in the days of Ine and
Ælfred; but the evidence is not entirely conclusive. Indeed,
a provision of Ine, relied upon by Schroeder to prove that
the price had not been paid at the betrothal, appears to
show the opposite, according to the reading of Liebermann.
"If a man buy a woman (as a wife) and the gifta or tradition
take not place, let him (the woman's guardian) give the
money back (to the bridegroom), pay as much more as penalty,
and recompense the betrothal sureties (byrgean) in as
much as the breach of their pledge is worth."<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> Even with
this reading it is just possible that the money restored was
the <i>arrha</i>; and that betrothal sureties were required mainly
to secure damage in case the bride were not actually transferred.
A law of Ælfred likewise shows the practice of
taking surety; but in this case also it seems uncertain
whether the pledges were given for the payment of the
bride-money; for damage on failure to surrender the bride
as a maid; or for both bride-price and damage combined,
though the last hypothesis seems the most probable. "If a
betrothed woman commit adultery, if she be of ceorlish
degree, let a penalty of sixty shillings be paid to the betrothal
sureties, and let it be in live-stock, things of value;
and in it let no (unfree) man be given." If the woman be
worth six hundred or twelve hundred shillings <i>wergeld</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
penalty is fixed at one hundred or one hundred and twenty
shillings respectively.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> But another law of Ælfred seems
to reveal more clearly the second or transitional phase in
the history of the wedding contract; for the bride-price is
paid to the woman. It provides that in case a man sell
his daughter into servitude, and the purchaser "allow his
son to cohabit with her, let him (the son) marry her: and
let him see that she have raiment, and that which is the
worth of her maidhood, that is the weotuma; let him give
her that."<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>The transition from this last-named form of contract to
a third and still more liberal one was easy and natural.
Already in the tenth century the <i>beweddung</i> had become a
merely "formal contract," the <i>wed</i>, <i>wette</i>, <i>Treugelöbniss</i>,
<i>wadium</i>, or <i>fides facta</i> of the early laws.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> In this case
there was not even one-sided fulfilment through payment of
the <i>arrha</i>, which in the form of wine-money was merely
<em>promised</em> to the guardian;<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> but instead the agreement or
convention was accompanied by sureties to pay the <i>weotuma</i>
to the bride, and by a solemn act which created the obligation,
and was therefore essential to the contract. Originally
this solemn act consisted in giving and taking the straw
(<i>festuca</i>) on the part of the bride and bridegroom. Instead
of the straw, other objects were sometimes employed, such
as a piece of cloth, an arrow, a number of gloves, and the
like.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> The oath or vow was also substituted for the solemn
act; and, particularly in the later Middle Ages, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
popular symbol by which the contract was closed was a
"weakened" form of the oath, the <i>Handschlag</i>, or hand-fasting,
so famous in connection with the history of English
"secret" or "irregular" marriages.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> It should be noted
that after the betrothal assumes the form of the <i>wed</i>, the
<i>weotuma</i> ceases to be of real importance and becomes a gift
to the bride of little value; whereas now the object of real
concern in the convention is the <i>morgengifu</i>, or <i>morning-gift</i>.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>
This was originally a small voluntary gift to the bride
on the morning following the nuptials; but as the <i>weotuma</i>
decreased the morning-gift increased in importance. It
became customary to grant them both in the same instrument
at the betrothal; so, at length, they were merged and
became a regular legal provision for the widow. Such was
the Lombard <i>quarta</i><a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> and the Frankish <i>tertia</i>;<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> the Norman
<i>douaire</i>, and the <i>dos ad ostium ecclesiae</i> of Glanville, the
predecessors of the modern English dower.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p>This third phase of the <i>beweddung</i> may be clearly discerned
in the English laws of the pre-Norman period, and
seems to have been the prevailing form after the beginning
of the tenth century. The following formulary, dating perhaps
from the reign of Eadmund or Æthelstan, besides its
peculiar interest as being the earliest English betrothal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
ritual extant, is an excellent example of the formal contract,
though some of its provisions are not clear:</p>

<p>"1. If a man desire to betroth a maiden or a widow, and
it so be agreeable to her and her friends, then it is right that
the bridegroom, according to the law of God, and according
to the customs of the world, first promise and give a 'wed'
to those who are her 'foresprecas,' that he desire her in such
wise that he will keep her, according to God's law, as a
husband shall his wife: and let his friends guarantee that.</p>

<p>"2. After that, it is to be known to whom the 'foster-laen'<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
belongs: let the bridegroom again give a 'wed' for
this: and let his friends guarantee it.</p>

<p>"3. Then, after that, let the bridegroom declare what he
will grant her, in case she choose his will, and what he will
grant her, if she live longer than he.</p>

<p>"4. If it be so agreed, then it is right that she be entitled
to half the property, and to all, if they have children in
common, except she again choose a husband.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></p>

<p>"5. Let him confirm all that which he has promised with
a 'wed;' and let his friends guarantee that.</p>

<p>"6. If they then are agreed in everything, then let the
kinsmen take it in hand, and betroth their kinswoman to
wife, and to a righteous life, to him who desired her, and
let him take possession of the 'bohr'<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> who has control of
the 'wed.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"7. But if a man desire to lead her out of the land, into
another thane's land, then it will be advisable for her that
her friends have an agreement that no wrong shall be done
to her; and if she commit a fault, that they may be nearest
in the 'bot,' if she have not whereof she can make 'bot.'"<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>The form of betrothal here described is that of the <i>wed</i>.
The <i>foster-laen</i>, or wine-money, a substitute for the <i>arrha</i>,
is not paid down, but it is merely promised to the guardian;
while the morning-gift&mdash;"in case she choose his will"&mdash;and
the <i>weotuma</i>&mdash;"if she live longer than he"&mdash;are the
important elements, and these belong to the bride.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>Such was the form of <i>beweddung</i> generally prevailing
among the Germanic nations about the time of the Norman
Conquest. It had been reached, as we have seen, only
through several successive phases of development, not sharply
defined, but overlapping each other. In the first stage, falling
mainly or wholly within the prehistoric era, the betrothal
is a real contract, according to which there is two-sided fulfilment.
The payment of the price and the delivery of the
bride go hand in hand.<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> In the second stage, existing at
any rate from the time of Tacitus onward, the transaction is
still in form a real contract of sale, but there is only one-sided
fulfilment. The purchase price is paid to the guardian,
but the tradition of the bride is postponed. Next a solemn
act through payment of a nominal sum, or <i>arrha</i>, is deemed
sufficient, the payment of the actual price, or <i>weotuma</i>, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
reserved for the nuptials, when, often, it is paid, not to the
guardian, but to the bride, disclosing to us the genesis of
the dower. The <i>beweddung</i> is still a real contract, but
not a contract of sale. Finally, even one-sided fulfilment
is no longer required. Nothing is paid and nothing
is transferred at the betrothal, which now consists of promises
and sureties, accompanied by a solemn act which
engendered the obligation. The real contract of sale has
been transformed into a merely formal contract, which provides
for future fulfilment on the part of both guardian and
bridegroom.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the second act in marriage, the <i>gifta</i>,
or actual "giving" of the bride to the husband. Here there
is no lack of ceremony and solemn phrases. Legally the
<i>gifta</i> is a distinct transaction subsequent to the betrothal
in the order of time.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> Very generally in German lands
late autumn or early winter was the favorite season for the
celebration of marriages. So also, during the waxing moon,
a Tuesday or a Thursday was preferred for the wedding day.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>
As among the Greeks, Romans, and Hindus,<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> the nuptial ceremony
appears to have consisted of three parts: the solemn
tradition, the joyous home-bringing of the bride, and the
festal initiation into the wedded life in the bridegroom's house.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Of these the <i>gifta</i>, or tradition, is most important, and it
takes place in the home of the bride.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> The father or
guardian by blood takes the lead in the proceedings, and is
thus the prototype of the modern priest or magistrate. The
first act is the solemn surrender of the bride together with
the symbols of the husband's power and protection: the
sword, the hat, and mantle, or other objects of similar significance.
Then, on reception of the bride, the bridegroom
pays the <i>weotuma</i>, or delivers the charter providing for the
morning-gift or other allowance for the widow; and, at the
same time, makes symbolical assertion of the power which
he thus acquires over the wife: for example, by treading
upon her foot&mdash;a custom, says Sohm, which at later time
finds a more refined expression in the delivery of a shoe or
slipper.<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> From this arose the belief, still existing in some
parts of Germany, that the bride will rule the family, if
before the altar, after the blessing is pronounced by the
priest, she places her foot upon that of the bridegroom.
"Who carries the slipper rules."<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></p>

<p>A point which requires special notice is the relative legal
importance of the <i>beweddung</i> and the <i>gifta</i>. "Whether the
marriage begins with the betrothal, or with the delivery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the bride to the bridegroom, or with their physical union,
is one of the many doubtful questions."<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> According to the
view of Sohm, which is defended with his usual acuteness, the
betrothal of the early laws is not, as commonly held, a
<i>pactum de contrahendo</i>, a contract for the future giving in
marriage,<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> but the essential part of the marriage itself. It
is the only declaration of will, the only ground of legitimate
marriage, which is not created, but merely consummated
at the <i>gifta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> Those who are bound by contract are
in respect to third parties practically husband and wife.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>
The ground of the husband's title is the betrothal and not
the nuptials. Either party can bring action in the courts
for breach of the contract. The bridegroom cannot compel
the delivery of the bride, but he may sue for the recovery of
the <i>weotuma</i> and an additional fine.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> On the other hand, a
breach of the contract by the bridegroom is punished by
forfeiture of the <i>weotuma</i>, and possibly also by a fine.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>
The betrothal created the negative effects of marriage&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
obligation of connubial fidelity. The bridegroom could
maintain his title as a husband against all third parties.
The <i>gifta</i> conveyed the positive rights, such as the power of
the husband over the person and property of the wife. It is
the completion of that which has gained its legal significance
from the betrothal.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>

<p>The theory of Sohm has elicited much controversy.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> It
is clear that the ancient betrothal was of greater legal significance
than the modern; but "on the other hand," to
quote the judgment of Pollock and Maitland, "it seems too
much to say that the betrothal was the marriage;" for the
fulfilment of the contract could not be enforced. Moreover,
they justly urge, we cannot be certain that betrothal by the
"woman's father or other protector was essential to a valid
marriage; we have to reckon with the possibility&mdash;and
it is somewhat more than a possibility&mdash;of marriage by
capture. If the woman consented to the abduction, then,
according to the theory which the Christian church was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
gradually formulating, there would be all the essentials of a
valid marriage, the consent to be husband and wife and the
sexual union."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>


<h3>II. RISE OF FREE MARRIAGE: SELF-BEWEDDUNG AND
SELF-GIFTA</h3>

<p>Already in the eleventh century the forms of marriage
were entering upon another stage. It is possible, in the
historical period, as already seen, that a valid marriage could
arise in abduction, through subsequent payment of a fine;
and it is not impossible that side by side with wife-purchase
the custom of free marriage by simple agreement of the
parties may have existed, as we have found it existing among
other peoples. But the practice could not have been widely
extended, and it may imply merely the indulgence or silent
consent of the legal protector.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> Hitherto, so far as the positive
provisions of the law-books are concerned, betrothal by
the natural guardian or his representative<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> had been essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
to a valid contract. Originally the father could betroth
his daughter even against her will.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> But, just as the guardianship
of the husband as respects the wife's property gradually
becomes transformed into a merely formal guardianship
or judicial control,<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> so the power of the father is first weakened
by granting the daughter a veto on the choice of a
bridegroom; that is, by making her consent necessary to a
binding contract; and then, presently, the relations of guardian
and ward are entirely transposed: self-betrothal by the
daughter constitutes a valid contract, while the father is
allowed only a veto power. Naturally it was the widow,
in the case of a second marriage, who first succeeded in
emancipating herself from tutorial control. Among the
Germans in the time of Tacitus it was against popular
usage, if not illegal, for a widow to marry again.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> But in
the folk-laws she appears on practically the same footing
as a girl in this regard;<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> and placed as she was "between
two families," with the "possibility of recourse to her own
kindred" in case her first husband's relatives as possessors
of the <i>mund</i> over her refused their assent to a second
marriage, she soon succeeded in freeing herself entirely
from such restraints.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>Canute forbids the marriage of a maiden against her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
will.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> If consent of father or guardian be not obtained,
the betrothal is still binding, but the daughter may be punished
by loss of inheritance. Thus early do we find the
beginning of the private marriages, which subsequently,
under the names of "irregular" or "clandestine," played
so great a rôle in the history of matrimonial law.</p>

<p>The form of contract observed in self-betrothal is usually
the <i>wed</i>, sealed by the <i>Handschlag</i> or hand-fasting. The
"real contract" through payment of the <i>arrha</i> is, however,
also retained; but the <i>arrha</i> is paid, not to the guardian,
but to the bride, and appears most frequently in the form of
the ring, so well known to us as the betrothal or "engagement"
ring.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> The ring had been used by the Romans as
<i>arrha</i>; and, like the bridal wreath and the bridal veil, it
seems to have been borrowed from them by the Germans.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
On the other hand, though there can be little doubt of the
historical connection of the betrothal ring and its duplicate,
the wedding ring, with the <i>arrha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> whether or not it may be
regarded as a surviving symbol of the former servitude of
the wife must depend upon the acceptance or rejection of
the view that the actual sale-marriage, as opposed to the
transfer of the <i>mund</i>, ever existed among the Teutonic
peoples. "A favorite theory," says Henry Adams, "has
insisted upon regarding the wedding ring as a badge of
servitude or a symbol of purchase. This idea cannot be
maintained. The wedding ring appears in its origin to
have been merely the earnest money which bound the contract
of marriage between the father and the husband, and
was not the only symbol of the kind in early custom,
although no other survives in modern use. The ring proved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
not that marriage was a sale, but that marriage was a civil
contract executed according to the strict formalities of contracts
in the primitive law; it proved, not that women were
deprived of rights, but that their rights were secured to
them in marriage by the most careful provisions known to
early society."<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> This is, of course, a very emphatic statement
of one side of the case; and it should not be overlooked
that the ring may stand as a symbol of equitable contract;
and yet the <i>arrha</i>, which the ring is, may mark but the
intermediate stage in the evolution of the betrothal from the
ancient process of actual sale. Nor does the connection of
the betrothal ring with the Roman and German <i>arrha</i>
necessarily exclude other historical associations. Kulischer,<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>
for instance, traces its origin to wife-capture. Like the
betrothal band or thread, which sometimes appears with it
or in its place, he believes that the ring symbolizes the
fetters with which the captive maid was bound. But the
evidence to support this theory is not conclusive.<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> The
practice of exchanging rings, of giving a ring to the bridegroom
as well as to the bride, did not arise until the later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> In England the drinking of a cup of wine
and the breaking of a gold piece between the bride and
bridegroom appear as forms of the <i>arrha</i>.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> Naturally after
the <i>arrha</i> is paid to the bride it becomes confused with the
<i>wed</i>, and soon all distinction between the two forms of contract
is lost. "Indeed at an early day the arrha was called
a wed, and it was legally indifferent whether the oath, hand-fasting
or other wed, or the ring or penny<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> were used.
Therefore the ring and penny are found in conjunction with
the glove; that is, with a real wed. And it is especially of
interest that the English language still calls marriage a
wedding, and that in England the ring (that is the arrha) is
still used to wed the bride."<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>Simultaneously with the rise of self-betrothal, the bride
gained also the right of self-<i>gifta</i>. The parties might conduct
the ceremony themselves.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> But in place of the natural
guardian, who originally possessed the sole legal right to
officiate at the tradition of the bride, appears often a "chosen
guardian," selected by the bride or by the betrothed couple.
The person thus selected may be the father or other relative
of the bride, or any third person whatever.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> Moreover, in
the marriage rituals of the eleventh century<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> an <em>orator</em> or
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fürsprecher</i> appears, who acts as an "assistant" to the
natural guardian, dictating the solemn phrases of the ritual
and guiding the whole proceeding. Friedberg regards the
orator as the predecessor of the priest, and thus, of course, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the civil magistrate as conductor of the nuptial ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>
But Sohm has shown that the functions of the priest or
magistrate grew out of those of the "chosen guardian," and
that the "<i>Trauung</i> by a <i>Fürsprecher</i> is in itself a contradiction."
The latter is "never an actor, but always an aid to
the actor. He has in truth only to speak, nothing to do."<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
While thus theoretically there is a great difference between
the orator and the chosen guardian, and both could, and
probably did, for a time participate in the same ceremony,
still the practical result is in accordance with the view of
Friedberg. For if, as Sohm has shown, the motive for the
creation of the institution of orator was the fact that the
elaborate phrases of the old rituals were rapidly passing
from the memories of the people, and it was necessary to
call in a lawyer or other person skilled therein to assist the
parties,<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> it is certain that the chosen guardian, whether layman
or priest, soon satisfied this necessity, and ultimately
inherited the functions of the orator.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

<p>From about the beginning of the thirteenth century self-<i>gifta</i>
was the only form of nuptials; and an important result
of the custom was the gradual omission of the solemn symbols,
such as the giving of the sword, hat, or mantle, indicative
of the transfer of the powers of guardianship. The
tradition of the bride was no longer a real tradition. The
<i>gifta</i> had become a simple oral declaration of union.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>
Besides this modification of the ceremony is another, both
of which have been retained to our own times. "We often
find that the chosen guardian not only gives the bride to
the bridegroom, but likewise the bridegroom to the bride;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
because, in reality, he occupies the same position in regard
to each, that is a position implying no power."<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> Thus the
marriage is no longer a surrender of the power of the
guardian and a transfer of the same to the bridegroom, but
only the expression of a mutual gift.<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>Self-<i>gifta</i> and the practice of choosing a third party to
assist the bride has an important bearing, as already intimated,
on the development of the functions of the clergy in
the marriage celebration. But before discussing this point
it is desirable to notice another fact essential for a proper
understanding of the present forms of solemnization. From
the eleventh century onward it became customary in Europe
to repeat the ceremony of betrothal, or "spousals," at the
nuptials. The rituals which have been preserved are divided
into two parts. "The first part contains a formal contract
of betrothal with the guardian (<i>Vogt</i>) of the bride in the
form of a wed. The second part contains the <i>Trauung</i>
through the solemn surrender of the bride by the guardian."<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>
This remarkable dualism is the most striking feature of the
present marriage service of the English church,<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> which is
derived through the liturgies of Elizabeth and Edward VI.<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>
from the most ancient manuals, particularly those of Hereford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Durham, Sarum, and York. The betrothal comes first,
and it is always a contract in words of the future tense, corresponding
to the <i>sponsalia per verba de futuro</i> of the
canonists, which will again be referred to. In the York
service, for example, the priest says to the man: "Wylt
thou have this woman to thy wyfe?" and to the woman:
"Wylt thou have this man to thy husbande?" Each party
answers: "I wyll." Then takes place the solemn tradition,
or giving of the bride to the bridegroom, who says, in words
of the present tense: "Here I take thee N. to my wedded
wyfe;" and the woman responds in the same formula:
"Here I take thee N. to my wedded husbande."<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p>

<p>But the repetition of the betrothal is of no legal significance,
save as a guaranty of the existence of a contract
before the actual union. It is a "declaratory" act, a mere
confession of betrothal. As a result of the repetition there
soon arises an entire confusion in the symbols. In a Suabian
ritual of the twelfth century the guardian delivers to
the bridegroom "not only the sword, hat, and mantle, that
is, symbols of the <i>gifta</i>, but also the <i>wette</i> or wed, the ring
and penny, that is, symbols of the betrothal. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
bridegroom in the ring and penny, instead of paying, actually
received the remnants of the old purchase price of the
wife."<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a></p>

<p>In our own civil-marriage ceremonies, where the dualism
does not usually appear, the responses of the parties, the
"Yes," "I do," or "I will," are nothing more than the survival
of the ancient private betrothal, now recognized by law
as the only essential parts of the nuptial ceremony; while
the wedding ring is merely a duplicate of the betrothal or
engagement ring, both being the survival of the <i>arrha</i> and,
therefore, of the ancient purchase price of the bride.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p>The primitive and mediæval marriage whose development
has thus been traced to the thirteenth century was not
"civil" marriage in the strict sense of the word; that is, a
marriage contracted under sanction of the civil authority, as
opposed to one solemnized by authority of the church and
according to ecclesiastical forms.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> It was a civil marriage
only as being a lay marriage. There is no trace of any such
thing as public license or registration; no authoritative intervention
of priest or other public functionary. It is purely a
private business transaction. Either the guardian gives
away the bride and conducts the ceremony; or else the
solemn sentences of the ritual are recited independently by
the betrothed couple themselves. These formalities and the
presence of the friends and relatives<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> are the only means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
publicity, the only substitute for the modern cognizance of
the state.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> Rights and obligations growing out of the marriage
contract are enforced in the local or national courts
just as other civil rights and obligations are enforced. Only
gradually was the ancient usage in this regard superseded.
Slowly but firmly was the exclusive jurisdiction of the church
in matrimonial causes established. Spiritual courts and the
canon law came into existence. In England after the Norman
Conquest the removal of ecclesiastical suits from the
temporal to the new church tribunals led eventually to
serious evils. With the Reformation the way was open for
the intervention of the civil power. Beginning in Holland
and America, the state has claimed her right to control the
marriage celebration and the administration of matrimonial
law as being of vital interest to society. How this came to
pass will be explained in the following chapters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

RISE OF ECCLESIASTICAL MARRIAGE: THE CHURCH
ACCEPTS THE LAY CONTRACT AND CEREMONIAL</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note VII.</span>&mdash;For the original Christian usage
the writings of the early Fathers are of primary interest, and an English
version of them is available in <cite>The Ante-Nicene Fathers</cite> (Buffalo,
1885-87), edited by Roberts and Donaldson and revised by A. C. Coxe.
An indispensable handbook and bibliographical guide for the study of
this subject, as well as for a multitude of questions connected with the
first eight centuries of Christian history, is Smith and Cheetham's
<cite>Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</cite> (London, 1875-80), particularly
Meyrick's article, "Marriage," and Ludlow's clear and thoroughly critical
discussions of the "Benediction," "Betrothal," and "Arrhae." Important
sources for this chapter are also the <cite>Corpus juris civilis</cite>
(Berlin, 1872), edited by Krüger and Mommsen; Richter and Friedberg's
<cite>Corpus juris canonici</cite> (Leipzig, 1881-); Haddan and Stubbs's
<cite>Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents</cite> (Oxford, 1869-78); Wilkins's
<cite>Concilia</cite> (London, 1736-37); Gee and Hardy's <cite>Documents</cite> (London
1896); Glanville's <cite>Tractatus</cite>, in Vol. II of Phillips's <cite>Reichs- und Rechtsgeschichte</cite>
(Berlin, 1827-28); and with these may be used to advantage
Johnson's <cite>Collection of the Laws and Canons of the Church of England</cite>
(London, 1850). On marriage at the church door, <cite>The Old English
Homilies</cite> (London, 1868); Gregory's <cite>Pastoral Care</cite> (London, 1871);
Hengham's <cite>Summa parva</cite> (London, 1737); Home's <cite>Mirror of Justices</cite>
(ed. Whittaker, London, 1895); Fitzherbert's <cite>New Natura Brevium</cite>
(Dublin, 1793); as well as Fleta, Britton, and Bracton, have furnished
illustrative passages.</p>

<p>The evolution and character of the celebration are best seen in the
marriage rituals themselves. For the European practice in general, including
the English rites, consult the second book of Selden, <cite>Uxor
ebraica</cite> (Frankfort on the Oder, 1673); or the same in Vol. II (III, as
bound) of his <cite>Opera omnia</cite> (London, 1726); and the first book of Martene,
<cite>De antiquis ecclesiae ritibus</cite> (Antwerp, 1763-64), in both of which
works a large number of rituals, with a mass of other useful materials,
will be found. Some portions of Martene are extracted by Michelet in
chap. ii of his <cite>Origines du droit français</cite> (Paris, 1857); and many rituals,
both of the East, and the West, are epitomized in Palmer, <cite>Origines
liturgicae</cite> (3d ed., Oxford, 1839), the use of which is facilitated by Beal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
<cite>Analysis of Palmer's Orig. Lit.</cite> (Cambridge, 1856). Some of the earliest
Christian <i>sacramentaria</i>, the eleventh-century ritual of Rennes, and
various other mediæval <i>ordines</i> are republished by Dieckhoff, <cite>Die
kirchliche Trauung</cite> (Rostock, 1878). Sohm, <cite>Eheschliessung</cite>, gives the
Rennes service above named, as well as those mentioned in Bibliographical
Note VI; and the principal parts of the twelfth century "Pontifical
ou rituel de lire" are quoted by Léon Gautier in his fascinating book
<cite>La chevalerie</cite> (Paris, 1884), where may be found the best and most detailed
account existing of the rites and social usages connected with a
mediæval French marriage. Most important of all for the present purpose,
however, are the ancient English liturgies. That of Sarum (Salisbury)
is published by Maskell, <cite>Monumenta ritualia ecclesiae anglicanae</cite>
(Oxford, 1882), with the essential clauses of the York service in the
margin; while the rituals of Salisbury, York, and Hereford, together
with extracts from ten other marriage services, ranging all the way
from the eighth to the fifteenth century, are contained in Vol. LXIII
of the Surtees Society <cite>Publications</cite> (London, 1875). With these may
be compared the Catholic forms in the <cite>Rituale romanorum Pauli
Quinti</cite> (Rome, 1816); and those of the Reformation in the <cite>Liturgies of
Edward VI.</cite> (Cambridge, 1844); and the <cite>Liturgies of Elizabeth</cite> (Cambridge,
1847), both in the publications of the Parker Society. The
earlier of these may also be found in the "First" <cite>Book of Common
Prayer</cite>, 1549 (exact reprint, black letter, London, 1844); or in the
"Second" <cite>Book of Common Prayer</cite>, reprinted in the same style at
London in the same year. With these collections will be found useful
Lathbury, <cite>History of the Book of Common Prayer</cite> (2d ed., Oxford and
London, 1859); and Daniel, <cite>The Prayer Book</cite> (London, 1877). The
marriage rituals of the modern Greek, Roman, and English churches
are given in Bingham (J. F.), <cite>The Christian Marriage Ceremony</cite> (New
York, 1871); and the English service, with discussion, may also be found
in Tegg, <cite>The Knot Tied</cite> (London, 1877); and Moore, <cite>How to Be Married</cite>
(London, 1890).</p>

<p>The principal sources for the study of the Council of Trent are
Richter-Schulte, <cite>Canones et decreti concilii tridentini</cite> (Leipzig,
1853); Theiner, <cite>Acta genuina concilii tridentini</cite> (Zagrabrae, Croatiae,
1874); Father Sarpi (Pietro Soave Polano), <cite>Historie of the Council
of Trent</cite> (London, 1620), opposing the action of the Council; and
his antagonist Pallavicino, <cite>Istoria del Concilio di Trento</cite> (Rome,
1833); or the Latin version of the same by Giattino (Antwerp, 1670).
A convenient collection on this subject is Waterworth, <cite>Canons and
Decrees of the Council of Trent</cite> (New York, 1848); while valuable
monographs are Salis, <cite>Die Publikation des tridentinischen Rechts der
Eheschliessung</cite> (Basel, 1888); Leinz, <cite>Die Ehevorschrift des Concils von
Trient</cite> (Freiburg, 1888); Fleiner, <cite>Die tridentinische Ehevorschrift</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
(Leipzig, 1892); and Meurer, "Die rechtliche Natur des trid. Matrimonial-Decrets,"
in <cite>ZKR.</cite>, XXII (Freiburg, 1889). The action of the
Council is treated in Esmein, <cite>Le mariage en droit canonique</cite> (Paris,
1891); Madan, <cite>Thelyphthora</cite> (London, 1781); Bohn, <cite>Political Cyclopædia</cite>
(London, 1860); as also by Sohm and Friedberg. Froude's <cite>Lectures on
the Council of Trent</cite> (New York, 1896) are too general to be of value for
the present subject.</p>

<p>For the great case of Regina <i>v.</i> Millis, historically so surprising, the
<cite>Report of the Cases of Regina v. Millis et Regina v. Carroll in the
Queen's Bench, Ireland</cite> (Dublin, 1842); and 10 Clark and Finnelly, <cite>Reports
of Cases Decided in the House of Lords</cite>, are indispensable. In
connection therewith read Sir John Stoddart, <cite>Observations on the
Opinion</cite> (London, 1844); his <cite>Letter to Lord Brougham</cite> (London, 1844);
and Elphinstone's paper in the <cite>Law Quarterly Review</cite>, V (London,
1889). To supplement these may be consulted the Jesuit Sanchez's
treatise, <cite>Disputationum de matrimonii sacramento</cite> (Venice, 1625); the
older handbook of Lyndwood, <cite>Provinciale</cite> (n. p., 1505; or Oxford, 1779);
and, in general, Bishop, <cite>Marriage, Divorce, and Separation</cite> (Chicago,
1891); Stephens, <cite>Laws of the Clergy</cite> (London, 1848); Reeves, <cite>History
of the English Common Law</cite>, IV; Bright, <cite>Husband and Wife</cite> (New
York, 1850); the concise and accurate discussion of Pollock and Maitland,
<cite>History of the English Law</cite>, II; and the masterly investigation
of Friedberg in his <cite>Eheschliessung</cite>. For the more celebrated earlier
cases with which the judgments in the Queen <i>v.</i> Millis are not in harmony
see 1 Roll, <i>Abridgement</i>, 353 (Foxcroft's case, <i>ca.</i> 1282); Year Book
34 Edward I. (Delheith's case, 1305); 2 Haggard, <cite>Consistory Reports</cite>,
54-137 (Dalrymple v. Dalrymple, 1811); 2 Coke's <cite>Reports</cite>, 355-59 (Bunting
<i>v.</i> Lepingwell); especially the numerous decisions in Hale's unique
<cite>Precedents and Proceedings in Criminal Causes, 1475-1640</cite> (London,
1847); and compare the later case of Beamish <i>v.</i> Beamish, 1859-61, in
Clark, 9 <cite>House of Lords Cases</cite> (Boston, 1871), which follows the precedent
in Queen <i>v.</i> Millis, giving a history of matrimonial laws from
Anglo-Saxon times. On this decision there is a very instructive passage
in Pollock, <cite>First Book of Jurisprudence</cite> (London, 1896). On Dalrymple
<i>v.</i> Dalrymple consult Dodson's <cite>Report of the Judgment of Sir William
Scott</cite> (London, 1811). See further the note at the close of this chapter.</p>

<p>At the head of all scientific historical writers on the rise of ecclesiastical
marriage is Sohm whose main thesis, that the early canon law
of the marriage contract rests on the principles of German custom, has
fairly withstood the test of criticism. His principal work on this subject,
<cite>Eheschliessung</cite>, elsewhere mentioned, is supplemented by the <cite>Zur
Trauungsfrage</cite> (Heilbronn, 1879), and the <cite>Obligatorische Civilehe</cite>
(Weimar, 1880); and in these he has proved beyond reasonable doubt
that the <em>legal</em> participation of the church in the nuptial celebration is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of late origin. Agreeing with Sohm in his main conclusion, but differing
on some questions, is Schubert, <cite>Die evangelische Trauung</cite> (Berlin,
1890); and he is in part anticipated by Biener in the much earlier
"Beiträge zu der Geschichte der Civilehe," in <cite>Zeitschrift für deutsches
Recht und Rechtswissenschaft</cite>, XX, 119-44 (Tübingen, 1861). He is
stoutly opposed on all the main points in Sehling's able monograph,
<cite>Die Unterscheidung der Verlöbnisse im kanonischen Recht</cite> (Leipzig,
1887); and also, especially regarding the late origin of the legal ecclesiastical
celebration, by Dieckhoff in the work already mentioned, as
also in his <cite>Civilehe und kirchliche Trauung</cite> (Rostock, 1880); Moy,

<h3>I. THE PRIMITIVE CHRISTIAN BENEDICTION, THE BRIDE-MASS,
AND THE CELEBRATION <i>AD OSTIUM ECCLESIAE</i></h3>

<p>It is a noteworthy fact that the early church accepted and
sanctioned the existing temporal forms of marriage. Her
energy was directed mainly to the task of enforcing her own
rules relating to marriage disabilities, such as those arising
in affinity or nearness of kin; to devising restraints upon
the freedom of divorce and second marriage; and to administering
matrimonial judicature.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> But the existing legal
character and the popular forms of betrothal and nuptials
were not disturbed. During the period preceding the Teutonic
invasion, speaking broadly, the church adhered to the
Roman law and custom; thereafter those of the Germans,
even when the marriage consisted in the formal sale and
tradition of the bride, were accepted.<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> The betrothal of the
early canon law is, therefore, the Roman betrothal. It is a
<i>consensus sponsalitius</i>, or free agreement between the man
and the woman. Legally it is a <i>pactum de contrahendo</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
promise for future joining in marriage, which may be dissolved
at the pleasure of either party.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> It creates no obligation
which can give rise to action for damage or fulfilment.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>
It does not constitute even the initiation of marriage. The
marriage begins with the nuptials or actual wedded life,
which gives expression to the <i>consensus nuptialis</i>, or mutual
will of the parties to be husband and wife;<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> though, doubtless,
the church demands parental consent, without making it
absolutely essential.<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> On the other hand, it has been demonstrated
by Sohm, contrary to the view previously accepted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
that the two betrothals of the mediæval canon law are based
on the German betrothal.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> If not the marriage itself, it is
nevertheless, as already seen, an act for joining in marriage
which is not easily dissolved.</p>

<p>The only innovation effected by the primitive church was
of a purely religious character. Though she might content
herself with the Roman or the Germanic forms of marriage,
there remained an "ethical mission" peculiarly her own.
"In order at the very outset to fill the wedded life with the
blessing and spirit of the Christian life, the church, without
reference to the matrimonial law in force, demanded of her
members that the very beginning of marriage should be
placed under the word of God and be hallowed by its
power."<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> Hence, from the first century onward, we find
evidence of a priestly benediction usually in connection with
the betrothal and probably with the nuptials.<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> Thus Ignatius
declares that it "becomes both men and women who
marry, to form their union with the approval of the bishop,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
that it may be according to God.<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> Tertullian speaks of marriage
being "requested" of bishops, presbyters, or deacons;<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>
and he shows in another place that publicity was an important
motive for encouraging unions "in presence of the
church."<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> In a somewhat obscure passage of the treatise
addressed to his wife, which is much relied upon by sacerdotal
writers, he exclaims: "How should we be sufficient
to set forth the bliss of that marriage which the church
brings about, and the oblation confirms, and the benediction
seals, angels proclaim, the Father ratifies?"<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> But here a
legal importance is given to the benediction which it does
not seem to have gained until centuries later.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> A similar
doubt attaches to the words of Ambrose, who, writing
against mixed marriages, says: "For since marriage itself
should be sanctified by the priestly veil and by benediction,
how can that be called a marriage where there is no agreement
of faith?"<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> But, "as Selden has observed, the like
benedictions were often claimed in behalf of many other
kinds of contract besides that of marriage&mdash;a sale, for
instance."<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> In the eastern church likewise the letters of
Gregory Nazienzen and the silence of Chrysostom show that
the benediction was without legal significance.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> By the
Roman law no betrothal or nuptial ceremonial is prescribed.
The solemnities were determined by local custom; and these
the early Christians were willing to accept. For centuries
a marriage liturgy was not adopted either in the East or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the West.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> According to Tertullian, no "breath of idolatry"
attaches even to the heathen ceremonies connected with
espousals,<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> among which he mentions the ring, the kiss, the
veil, and the joining of hands.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> The ring came more and
more under German influence to be used as an <i>arrha</i>.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>
Witnesses were required; and in connection with the nuptials
we hear also of the "pomp" or procession to the bridegroom's
home, and the "crowning" of the bride or the
wedded pair, usually with flowers.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<p>It seems probable, then, that during the first three or
four centuries Christian marriages were not as a rule celebrated
in church.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> The betrothal or nuptial benediction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
was not essential to a valid marriage, however important it
may have been regarded from a religious point of view.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>
Gradually it became an established custom for the newly
wedded pair, after solemnization of the nuptials, to attend
religious services in the church and partake of the sacrament,
at the close of which the priest invoked a blessing
upon the future married life. But at first the church service
was the ordinary service; only after a considerable
interval were phrases introduced into the prayers especially
applicable to the wedded pair.<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<p>Thus stood the custom in the period immediately following
the conversion of the Teutonic nations. The nuptials
consisted of two distinct acts. The first was the <i>gifta</i>, or
traditional ceremony in the usual form. Thereafter, often
on the day following the bridal night,<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> the newly wedded
couple celebrated the bride-mass (<i>Brautmesse</i>) and received
the benediction of the priest. But this religious act had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
no legal significance. No doubt it was performed by all
good Christians as a religious duty. The benediction was
invoked on the married life, a fact of such immense ethical
importance, just as it was invoked on all important undertakings.
It was observed as a fitting solemnity for a believer
and not as a part of the marriage. Therefore in the case of
second marriages it was omitted.<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> Broadly stated, the canon
law maintained the validity of all proper marriages solemnized
without the priestly benediction, though spiritual
punishment might be imposed for neglect of religious duty.
Such is the view of Sohm, and it has been generally accepted.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>
Dieckhoff,<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> however, contests it at every point. He
holds that from early days the priestly benediction, whether
of betrothal or of nuptials, was an essential part of the
Christian marriage celebration. In support of the theory,
that originally the church really undertook to join persons
in wedlock, he presents three services from Roman <i>sacramentaria</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of the age of Charles the Great.<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> But it is by no
means certain that the words of the text relied upon for
proof are not of too recent origin to be convincing as to
early usage; and if they really belong to the time assigned,
they cannot, in face of other evidence, be accepted as showing
the general custom of the West, but rather, like the
often-cited Capitulary,<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> of 802, as merely revealing the aim
and desire of the church.</p>

<p>The introduction of the bride-mass constitutes the second
stage in the history of clerical marriage. In English history
it is represented by several spousal services which have
been published by the Surtees Society.<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> They cover the
period from the eighth to the eleventh century, beginning
with the Pontifical of Egbert, archbishop of York (732-66)
and ending with the <cite>Rede Boke</cite> of Darbye (<i>ca.</i> 1050), now
in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. These
services consist wholly of prayers and benedictions. There
is no mention of the mass, though doubtless the husband
and wife have already partaken of the communion before
the service. Apparently the function of the priest is purely
religious. It is merely an invocation of the divine blessing
upon the life of the newly wedded pair, and has no legal
significance. The nuptials have already been solemnized,
whether in the presence of the priest or not the formularies
do not explain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>
<p>But already in the tenth century we reach the beginning
of a third stage in the rise of the ecclesiastical ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>
The nuptials still consist of two distinct acts. The first is
the <i>gifta</i> proper, according to the usual temporal forms. It
is no longer a strictly private transaction,<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> but it takes place
before the church door&mdash;<i>ante ostium ecclesiae</i><a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>&mdash;in the presence
of the priest, who participates in the ceremony and closes
it with his blessing. The second act consists in the entrance
into the church and the celebration of the bride-mass, followed
by a second benediction. But the <i>gifta</i>, even in this
stage, is temporal and not ecclesiastical. It occurs "before
and not within the church," the motive usually assigned
being to induce an immediate attendance upon communion
on the very day of the nuptials instead of after an interval.
In reality, however, the custom is but a recognition of the
temporal nature of wedlock, which ought therefore to be
celebrated before and not within the consecrated building.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>
That such was the prevailing custom throughout the western
church during the Middle Ages is established by a mass of
evidence of the most convincing character. Besides the
testimony of chroniclers, historians, and literary men, we
have that of the law-books and legal writers, lay and ecclesiastical,
which make frequent mention of the assignment of
the wife's dower at the church door during the nuptial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
celebration.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> Moreover, many of the ancient rituals themselves
have been preserved. All these "are unanimous," says
Léon Gautier, following Martene, "in placing the principal
act of the marriage celebration, that is to say the consent of
the parties, at the entrance or in the porch of the church;"<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and what is thus affirmed for the rituals of France is equally
true for those of Germany<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> and England. "In the first
place," runs the opening rubric of the Sarum <i>Ordo ad
faciendum sponsalia</i>, "let the man and the woman stand
before the church door in the presence of God, the priest,
and the people, the man on the right of the woman, and the
woman on the left of the man." Here the bride and groom
remain during the nuptial celebration, the assignment of the
dower, and the closing benediction. Thereupon, as the rubric
directs, "let them enter the church as far as the steps of the
altar," where, after a psalm, they are to prostrate themselves
while a prayer is said in their behalf.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> The usage of Sarum
in this regard is typical, differing only in words and arrangement
from that of York, Hereford, or the other churches.
Indeed, marriage continues to be celebrated at the church
door until the sixteenth century, the liturgies of Edward
VI. and Elizabeth first requiring as a general observance the
ceremony to be performed in the body of the church.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the very earliest references to the presence of the
priest at the nuptials is contained in the last two sections of
the old English ritual of the tenth century already quoted
in part,<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> and this ritual may be regarded as marking the
transition to the period under consideration.</p>

<p>"8. At the nuptials there shall be a mass-priest by law;
who shall with God's blessing bind their union to all prosperity.</p>

<p>"9. Well is it also to be looked to, that it be known, that
they, through kinship, be not too nearly allied; lest that be
afterwards divided, which before was wrongly joined."<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a></p>

<p>It is evident, as Friedberg has remarked, that the office
of mass-priest in this ritual is of no legal significance. The
invocation of a divine blessing is merely a religious act
after the marriage is complete.<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> It is no more a part of the
<i>gifta</i> than is the caution, in the last section, against marriage
within the degrees of relationship forbidden by the
canons. It is plain that in this formulary the betrothal and
not the nuptials absorbs well-nigh the whole attention of the
lawgiver. It is manifestly the thing of deepest concern;
and in this the priest has no part.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

<p>According to Lingard, "there is no trace of any form of
marriage contract in ancient English sacramentaries previously
to the close of the twelfth century; and the earliest
mention of it appears in the constitutions of two English
prelates, Richard Poere, bishop of Sarum, and Richard de
Marisco, bishop of Durham, who ordered the parish priests
to teach the bridegroom this form, 'I take thee N. for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
wife,' and the bride a similar form, 'I take thee N. for my
husband.'"<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> This statement, however, may now require some
modification. Judging from its brevity and its condensed,
almost crude, diction, the ritual published by the Surtees
Society from a pontifical in the library of Magdalen College,
Oxford, may have originated at an earlier date in the twelfth
century;<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> and this seems all the more probable, for French
rituals, in which the priest takes a leading part in directing
the spousal contract, are preserved from a still earlier period.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>
However this may be, the rituals of Sarum, York, and
Hereford are among the most ancient, the most elaborate,
and the most instructive which have anywhere been preserved,
those of Sarum and York having been in force from
about the end of the twelfth century until 1549. They
contain a rich store of material for the student of the marriage
contract, carrying him back to the cradle of the English
race in the Saxon forests. Beneath the ecclesiastical
covering, the adventitious mass of prayers, psalms, and
benedictions, is a kernel of primitive Teutonic custom which
he will at once recognize.</p>

<p>The York service may be taken as a type, for it does
not differ in any important particular from the other two.
In it the advance of the clergy is very marked. The
priest directs or participates in the whole procedure. The
ceremony takes place before the church door, as the rubric
directs, the man standing "on the right of the woman and
the woman on the left of the man."<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> Then the priest is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
to ask the banns in the mother-tongue, following the
Latin formula prescribed in the ritual, first addressing the
people:</p>

<p>"Lo, bretheren, we are comen here before God and his
angels and all his halowes, in the face and presence of our
moder holy Chyrche, for to couple and to knyt these two
bodyes togyder, that is to saye, of this man and of this
woman, that they be from this tyme forthe, but one body
and two soules in the fayth and lawe of God and holy
Chyrche, for to deserue everlastynge lyfe what someuer that
they have done here before."</p>

<p>"I charge you on Goddes behalfe and holy Chirche, that
if there be any of you that can say any thynge why these
two may not lawfully be wedded togyder at this tyme, say it
nowe outher pryuely or appertly, in helpynge of your soules
and theirs bothe."</p>

<p>Secondly, addressing the man and the woman:</p>

<p>"Also I charge you both and eyther be your selfe, as ye

this mater."<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a></p>

<p>If no objection to the marriage is made, the priest, in
several long paragraphs of the service, explains the canons
relating to publication of banns, the times when the ecclesiastical
celebration is forbidden, and the evils growing out
of clandestine unions, with the penalty of three years' suspension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
from office for the priest who fails to prohibit such
marriages in his parish. Then follows the essential act, the
celebration of the <i>sponsalia</i>. This, as already mentioned,
is in two distinct parts. The first part is the repetition of
the betrothal <i>per verba de futuro</i>, the priest putting the
vows in the form of a question to each party. He says to
the man:</p>

<p>"<i>N.</i>, wylt thou haue this woman to thy wyfe and loue her
[and wirschipe hir<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>] and keep her, in sykenes and in helthe,
and in all other degrese be to her as a husbande sholde be
to his wyfe, and all other forsake for her, and holde the only
to her to thy lyues ende."</p>

<p>The man is to answer: "I wyll." The priest then says
to the woman:</p>

<p>"<i>N.</i>, wylt thou haue this man to thy husbande, and to be
buxum to hym [luf hym, obeye to him, and wirschipe<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> hym],
serue hym and kepe hym in sykenes and in helthe: and in
all other degrese be unto him as a wyfe shulde be to her
husbande, and all other to forsake for hym, and holde the
only to hym to thy lyues ende."</p>

<p>The woman is to say: "I wyll."</p>

<p>This closes the first part. The second part is the <i>gifta</i>,
or marriage properly so called, <i>per verba de praesenti</i>. The
priest says: "Who gyues me this wyfe?" "Then," runs the
Latin rubric, "shall the woman be given away by her father
or by a friend; if a maid, she shall have her hand bare; if
a widow, she shall have it covered."<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> The man shall receive
her to keep in God's faith and his own, as he has vowed
before the priest; and holding her by the right hand with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
his right hand, he shall plight the woman his troth in words
of the present tense, saying after the priest:</p>

<p>"Here I take thee <i>N.</i> to my wedded wyfe, to haue and
to holde, at bedde and at borde, for fayrer for fouler, for
better for warse, in sekeness and in hele, tyl dethe us departe,
and thereto I plyght the my trouthe;" and the woman makes
the same vow in the same words.</p>

<p>"Then shall the man place gold, silver, and a ring upon
a shield or a book. And the priest shall enquire whether
the ring has already been blessed." If not, the priest is to
bless it in prescribed form, and sprinkle it with holy water.
Then follows a curious ceremony. The bridegroom "takes
the ring with his three principal fingers, and says after the
priest, beginning with the thumb of the bride, '<i>In nomine
Patris</i>;' at the second finger, '<i>et Filii</i>;' at the third finger,
'<i>et Spiritus Sancti</i>;' at the fourth or middle finger, '<i>Amen</i>;'<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a>
and there he leaves the ring, because according to the
Decree ... 'in the middle finger there is a certain vein
extending to the heart.'"<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a></p>

<p>After this delicious bit of popular superstition, handed
down to our own days from remote antiquity, the bridegroom,
holding his bride by the hand, says after the priest:
"With this rynge I wedde the, and with this golde and siluer
I honoure the, and with this gyft I dowe thee."</p>

<p>The priest next "asks the dower of the woman." If "land
is given her in the dower," the bride "prostrates herself at
the feet of the bridegroom;" but the York ritual does not go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
so far as one manuscript of the Sarum manual, in requiring
that the woman shall "kiss the right foot" of her spouse.<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

<p>The ceremony ends with prayer and benediction, followed
by the entrance into the church for celebration of the bridal
mass.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a></p>

<p>The historical significance of the ritual just analyzed is
readily perceived.<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> In the ring, the gold, and the silver
there is a plain recognition of the <i>arrha</i>, though it was
coming to be regarded as a kind of symbolical assignment of
the wife's dower.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> It is noticeable that the tradition is still
conducted by the "father or a friend." It is a private lay
transaction in which the priest has no legal part. He is still
a mere orator, rather than a necessary actor, though there
is a manifest effort to gain the recognition of the priestly
office as essential to a Christian marriage. Martene has
pointed out that in all the early rituals the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
<i>vos conjungo</i><a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> are unknown. It is the "parties who marry themselves."
The matrimonial contract arises solely in their
consent.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a></p>


<h3>II. THE PRIEST SUPERSEDES THE CHOSEN GUARDIAN, AND
<i>SPONSALIA PER VERBA DE PRAESENTI</i> ARE VALID</h3>

<p>Thus it appears that between the first and twelfth centuries
the religious element in the marriage ceremony runs
through three phases, not sharply defined by dates, but
overlapping and blending; and for the sake of clearness it
may be well to summarize the history of this development
before proceeding farther. (1) During about four centuries
no liturgy was prescribed; the ancient popular forms of contract
were accepted; the nuptials were usually celebrated in
the home of the bride, less often in church; and the priestly
benediction, though doubtless commended as a religious
duty, was not exacted by the church as essential to a legal
or a canonical marriage. (2) Between about the end of the
fourth century and the middle of the tenth the custom became
well established for the newly wedded pair to attend
religious service in the church to partake of the sacrament
and receive the priestly benediction on their future married
life; and this practice soon led to the institution of the
regular bride-mass, containing phrases directly applicable to
the nuptials. In the bride-mass may be found the genesis
of the ecclesiastical marriage liturgy; but it is a purely
religious office and adds nothing to the validity of the private
contract. (3) In the next phase, falling between the
tenth and the twelfth centuries, the clergy makes rapid
progress. An elaborate and imposing ritual is developed; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
priest, inheriting the functions of the ancient orator, directs
the entire celebration; the nuptial ceremony takes place
before the church door, and is followed by the bridal mass in
the church itself; but even now the priest is a mere helper,
and the religious service adds nothing to, nor its omission
takes nothing from, the validity of the nuptial contract.</p>

<p>The next and final step is comparatively easy and already
assured. By the beginning of the thirteenth century the
western church had entered upon a fourth phase in respect
to the solemnization of marriage. This was facilitated, according
to Sohm,<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> by the custom, already mentioned, of
choosing any third person as guardian to officiate at the
nuptials, marking the transition from the ancient tradition
through the natural guardian to the stage of self-<i>gifta</i> or
tradition by the bride herself&mdash;a stage which is fairly being
entered upon at the beginning of the thirteenth century.
This new and more liberal form of lay tradition led directly
to the <i>gifta</i> by the priest, or to ecclesiastical marriage
properly so called.<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> In the third stage of development the
priest could not venture to interfere with the prerogative of
the natural guardian to give his ward in marriage. He
could at most assist as orator and bestow his benediction.
But from the moment that custom sanctioned the choice of
any third person in place of the father or other natural protector,
the clergy appropriated this function as their exclusive
right. While the church "bestowed her blessing upon
the tradition through the natural guardian, she directed
against the lay chosen guardian her excommunication."<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>
So at this point arose the antagonism between private and
ecclesiastical marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> The motive of the church was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
clearly twofold. While she very naturally strove to gain
control of the nuptial celebration, to give more and more a
religious form to the institution already declared by her to
be a sacrament, she doubtless foresaw something of the evils
which would ensue from clandestine or private unions, now
that the consent of the parent or natural guardian was no
longer necessary, as in early days, for a valid marriage, and
therefore began to legislate in the interest of publicity.</p>

<p>Henceforth the rituals of the continent show plainly that
marriage was usually celebrated by the priest and not merely
in his presence; though the ceremony still takes place at
the church door. The parties no longer simply "marry
themselves," repeating after the priest the solemn words of
the nuptial vow; but in addition the priest "gives the woman
to the man, saying in Latin words: I join you in the name
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen;" and
this formula, taken from a typical French ritual of the fourteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> is never found, as already explained, in the
liturgies of the preceding period. It is highly important to
note that these words of power on the part of the priest do
not appear in the English service before the period of the
Reformation. In the earlier as well as in the later rituals the
parties are the real actors, although the priest is leader and
teacher in the whole ceremony. At most, so far as the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
of tradition is concerned, evidence of a mere transition<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>
from the third phase in the rise of ecclesiastical marriage
may be discerned. The priest does not step quite into the
place of the father or other relative. He is not quite a
"chosen guardian;" for he receives his power to "give"
the bride to the bridegroom from the natural guardian or
his representative, and not from the woman herself. Thus,
according to the ancient liturgy of York, the priest says,
"who gyues me this wyfe? Then the woman is given by
her father or by a friend;"<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> and this transitional form in
substance is still preserved in the modern service of the
English church.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> But, apparently, the function of the priest
in the <i>gifta</i> is more pronounced in the York manual than in
any of the other mediæval rituals which have been preserved.
In some of them, as a matter of fact, it receives no mention
at all.<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears, then, as regards the form of celebration, that
previous to the Reformation the church had not made so
great progress in England as in many places on the continent.
The <i>gifta</i> is still essentially the ancient private tradition,
in which the priest has at most a subordinate place;
and the words of power following, and as it were sealing, the
nuptial vow do not appear. Still there is a decided gain; for
the whole procedure is given a religious character through
the solemn prayers and benedictions, the authoritative definitions
of the nature of marriage, and the stately ceremonial of
the bridal mass, in all of which the priest is the central figure.</p>

<p>If now, turning from the evidence afforded by the content
of the prescribed rituals, we examine the legislation of
the church for enforcing the acceptance of these rituals, we
shall reach a similar result. Stated broadly in advance, the
English canons created a sharp distinction between legality
and validity. Lay marriages&mdash;that is, marriages solemnized
without the intervention of the church, including clandestine
unions as well as those privately contracted before witnesses
with parental consent&mdash;were opposed to canonical marriages:
and lay marriages were declared illegal under severe penalties,
even excommunication; while at the same time, if
once contracted in words of the present tense, they were
maintained as equally valid and equally sacramental in their
nature with those celebrated according to the authorized
liturgy before the priest.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

<p>During the Anglo-Saxon period various orders and regulations
commanding the benediction were passed. Theodore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
thus requires the priest, in the case of a first marriage, to
celebrate the mass, doubtless the ordinary service, and to
ask a benediction upon both parties;<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> while by the ritual of
the tenth century, already quoted, the nuptials are to be celebrated
before a mass-priest "who shall with God's blessing
bind their union to all prosperity."<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> But after the Conquest
more stringent measures were taken to secure publicity and
enforce the observance of religious rites. Especially important
is the celebrated constitution of Archbishop Lanfranc,
alleged to have been enacted at the Council of Winchester
in 1076, ordaining "that no man give his daughter or kinswoman
in marriage without the priest's benediction," and
declaring that otherwise "the marriage shall not be deemed
legitimate but as fornication."<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> Twenty-six years later, at
the Council of London, an attempt was made by Anselm to
put a check upon clandestine contracts, in a provision which
really defines the principle governing the decisions of the
ecclesiastical courts throughout the west. "Promises of
marriage made between man and woman without witnesses"
are declared to be "null if either party deny them."<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> In 1175
these acts were reinforced by a canon of Archbishop Richard,
taken from the decrees of Pope Ormisdas (Hormisdas) of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
year 514, ordering that "no faithful man, of what degree
soever, marry in private, but in public, by receiving the
priest's benediction. If any priest be discovered to have
married any in private let him be suspended from his office
for three years."<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> By a constitution of Archbishop Walter,
in the year 1200, it was further ordained that "no marriage
be contracted without banns thrice published in church, nor
between persons unknown;" and no marriage not publicly
solemnized in face of the church is "to be allowed of, except
by the special authority of the bishop."<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<p>These measures, and others later enacted in a similar
spirit,<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> have led to a serious misapprehension of the real
doctrine of the canon law. From them it has been zealously
argued that the prescribed religious celebration was
essential to a valid contract; and this view was strengthened
by the decree of Innocent III. at the fourth Lateran council,
1215, requiring the publication of banns as a general law
of the western church, which by a similar error was understood
to have ordained ecclesiastical marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> But in the
light of history it seems clear that all which was intended
by this decree, or by the constitution of Lanfranc and its
successors, was to declare the unblessed marriage illegal,
involving certain penalties or disadvantages, without touching
its validity.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> The lay courts, as will appear in the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
chapter, might deny full rights of dower and inheritance to
the issue of such unions; but after the thirteenth century,
as well as before, marriages celebrated without the intervention
of priest or magistrate were sustained by the church as
binding. As already emphasized at the outset of this discussion,
the private, even secret, agreement of the parties,
without consent of parent or guardian, if expressed in words
of the present tense, <i>sponsalia per verba de praesenti</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>
though not followed by cohabitation, was held to constitute
a valid marriage; and it could be sustained against a subsequent
contract publicly celebrated according to ecclesiastical
forms and followed by years of wedded life. This is
unquestionably the doctrine of the canon law of western
Christendom, as emphatically expressed in the decretal
epistle of Alexander III. to the bishop of Norwich presently
to be noticed;<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> and that it was accepted by the English
courts as a part of the law of the land is established by
conclusive evidence. Not until the Council of Trent, in the
middle of the sixteenth century, was there any general legislation
of the church to enforce ecclesiastical rites. This
council, after anathematizing those who deny that clandestine
marriages theretofore contracted by the sole agreement
of the parties and without parental consent are "true and
valid," decreed, contrary to the opinion of fifty-six prelates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
that thenceforward all marriages not contracted in the presence
of a priest and two or three witnesses shall be void.<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>
This decree was not accepted in England, and "clandestine"
marriages continued to be valid until the middle of the
eighteenth century; and until 1856, in Scotland, as is well
known, the mere consent of the parties, however expressed,
constituted a binding marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a></p>

<p>It follows that the unanimous opinion of the English
judges in the great case of the Queen <i>v.</i> Millis, 1844,
against the validity of a marriage not celebrated before an
ordained priest of the established church, is not supported
by the evidence of history as revealed in the doctrines of
the canon law and in the action of the ecclesiastical courts
during six centuries.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> The following are the main facts in
the history of this famous suit: In January, 1829, at Banbridge,
county of Down, Ireland, George Millis and Hester
Graham "entered into a contract of present marriage" in
the presence of John Johnstone, the "placed and regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
minister of the congregation of Protestant dissenters commonly
called Presbyterians, at Tullylish, near Banbridge,"
who performed a solemn religious ceremony according to
the usual rites of his sect. Thus there was a perfect and
binding contract <i>de praesenti</i> according to ecclesiastical law.
Later, while Hester was still living, Millis married Jane
Kenedy in England, using the forms of the established
church, of which he was a member. At the spring assizes
of 1842, for the county of Antrim, Ireland, Millis was
indicted for bigamy. The case was removed by <i>certiorari</i>
into the Irish court of Queen's Bench, where the four judges
were evenly divided; but Justice Perrin, who favored the
validity of the first marriage, withdrew his opinion <i>pro
forma</i>, that the case might go to the House of Lords for
definite settlement.<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> The Lords submitted the case to the
English judges for advice; and they unanimously decided
against the validity of the first marriage on the ground that
it had not been celebrated before a regular clergyman of the
English church. That the decision was hasty and in direct
opposition to history, as revealed in all the great cases, there
can now be small doubt. "We have here," says Bishop, "a
question of almost pure ecclesiastical law, submitted to a
tribunal composed of common-law and equity lawyers, who
necessarily possessed little or no knowledge of the subject. So
they ask advice, not from the ecclesiastical judges, whose functions
had qualified them to give it, but from the uninstructed
common-law judges. The latter were competent to learn,
but they were not allowed the necessary time. Lord Chief-Justice
Tindal, who delivered their opinion, complained of
the want of time for investigation; and the opinion throughout
shows the complaint to have been well founded."<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>This view is strongly supported by the action of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Lords. In spite of the united opinion of the judges, the final
deliberation of the six law peers resulted in a tie: Lords Cottenham,
Abinger, and Chancellor Lyndhurst holding the first
marriage to be void; and Lords Brougham, Denman, and
Campbell maintaining its validity. But since the case was
on appeal from the decision of another court, the result of
the tie was to declare the invalidity of unblessed wedlock.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p>Thus by a remarkable sequence of circumstances and
accidents was established the judicial interpretation of the
English law governing the marriage celebration.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> The decision
was therefore followed in another celebrated case,
that of Beamish <i>v.</i> Beamish, which came before the House
of Lords in 1861. This was a case of "clandestine" marriage,
the bridegroom himself performing the ceremony in a
private house according to the ritual of the established
church. In the record we are told that the "Rev. S. S.
Beamish, in the year 1831, became attached to a young lady
named Isabella Frazer (both being members of the United
Church of England and Ireland), and as he did not obtain
his father's consent to his marriage with her, he persuaded
her into a clandestine marriage, which, according to the
special verdict found in the case, was performed in the following
manner: 'On the 27th November, 1831, the Rev.
Samuel Swayne Beamish, being then a clergyman in holy
orders, went to the house of one Anne Lewis, in the city of
Cork, and there performed a ceremony of marriage between
himself and Izabella Frazer, by reading between them ...
the form of solemnization of matrimony used in said United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Church of England and Ireland, as set forth in the Book of
Common Prayer, ... by declaring' in words of the present
tense that he took the bride 'to his wedded wife,' she
making a similar avowal; by placing a ring on her finger;
and by pronouncing the blessing in the appointed form."
The court held the contract void, declaring that, since it was
"settled by the decision in the Queen <i>v.</i> Millis, that to constitute
a valid marriage by the common law of England, it
must have been celebrated in the presence of a clergyman in
holy orders, the fact that the bridegroom is himself a clergyman
in holy orders, there being no other clergyman present,
will not make the marriage valid." For "as to the manner
in which a marriage is to be celebrated, the law does not
admit of any difference between the marriage of a clergyman
and of a layman."<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>The singular motives underlying this decision have been
recently discussed in an instructive way by Sir Frederick
Pollock. It appears that a former judgment of the Lords
must be maintained, however absurd or however inconsistent
with history or justice it is felt to be. Already in 1852 and
again in 1860 Lord Chancellor Campbell had committed
himself to the dogma that the House of Lords is bound by
its own decisions. At the former date, answering Lord St.
Leonards, who holds the opposite view, he says: "I consider
it the constitutional mode in which the law is declared,
and that after such a judgment has been pronounced it can
only be altered by an Act of the Legislature."<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> When the
case of Beamish <i>v.</i> Beamish came "before the House of
Lords, the late Mr. Justice Willes virtually, though not professedly,
demonstrated, in a full and most learned opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
that the supposed difference between the law of England and
that of the rest of western Christendom was imaginary.
His reasons convinced Lord Campbell and Lord Wensleydale,
but Lord Campbell declared himself not at liberty to
act on his conviction;" though, for sound reasons which he
admits, he confessed that if competent for him he would ask
their Lordships to reconsider their judgment in the Queen
<i>v.</i> Millis. "But it is my duty," he adds, "to say that your
Lordships are bound by this decision as much as if it had been
pronounced <i>nemine dissentiente</i>." A "rule of law thus judicially
expressed must be taken as for law till altered by an
act of Parliament." The "law laid down as your <i>ratio decidendi</i>,
being clearly binding on all inferior tribunals, and all
the rest of the Queen's subjects, if it were not considered as
equally binding upon your Lordships, this house would be
arrogating to itself the right of altering the law, and legislating
by its own separate authority." It "may seem startling,"
comments Pollock, "that questions of legitimacy and
property should be treated as irrevocably settled by the
result of an equal division of the House of Lords, on argument
and information admittedly imperfect with regard to the
history of the law; that result, moreover depending on the
accident of the form in which the appeal was presented: but so
they were." Thus in Beamish <i>v.</i> Beamish an opinion of seventeen
years earlier was accepted as binding, "which in 1861
was believed by a majority of the House of Lords and the
judges who advised them, and is now believed by most competent
scholars, to be without any real historical foundation."<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

RISE OF ECCLESIASTICAL MARRIAGE: THE CHURCH
DEVELOPS AND ADMINISTERS MATRIMONIAL LAW</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note VIII.</span>&mdash;For the evolution of the canonical
theory of marriage the Richter-Friedberg <cite>Corpus juris canonici</cite> (Leipzig,
1881 ff.), Peter Lombard's <cite>Sententiae</cite> (Incunabula, <cite>Textus sententiarum</cite>,
1488, Sutro Library), and the <cite>Ante-Nicene Fathers</cite> (Buffalo,
1885-87) are of the first importance. The collections of Haddan and
Stubbs, Thorpe, Schmid, Hale, and Johnson, mentioned in Bibliographical
Note VII, are available for this chapter; as are also the collections
of Richter-Schulte, Theiner, and Waterworth, the works of
Sarpi and Pallavicino, the monographs of Salis, Fleiner, Riedler, and
Leinz, the papers of Meurer and Schulte, with the other authorities
already cited for the Council of Trent. Well-known treatises on the
canon law are Lyndwood, <cite>Provinciale</cite> (ed. of 1505 and Oxford, 1679);
Sanchez, <cite>Disputationum de s<sup>to</sup> matrimonii sacramento</cite> (Venice, 1625);
and Godolphin, <cite>Repartorium canonicum</cite> (3d ed., London, 1687). With
these may be used Smith, <cite>Elements of Ecclesiastical Law</cite> (New York,
1882); Phillimore, <cite>Ecclesiastical Law</cite> (London, 1873-76); Stephens, <cite>Laws
Relating to the Clergy</cite> (London, 1848); Burn, <cite>Ecclesiastical Law</cite> (London,
1842); and the excellent summary of Geary, <cite>Marriage and Family
Relations</cite> (London, 1892), chap, xvi, where the principal sources are
mentioned. Dodd's <cite>History of the Canon Law</cite> (London, 1884) is too
general to be of much service. A good handbook of Catholic doctrine,
with full citation of authorities, is Gury's <cite>Compendium of Moral
Theology</cite>; and in this connection may also be consulted Amat's convenient
<cite>Treatise on Matrimony</cite> (San Francisco, 1864); the works of
Cigoi, Didon, Roskovány, Perrone, and Scheicher-Binder described in
Bibliographical Note XI.</p>

<p>The rise of the system of enforced celibacy of the clergy, with the
consequent evils, is most fully treated by the brothers Theiner, <cite>Die
Einführung der erzwungenen Ehelosigkeit</cite> (3d ed., Barmen, 1891-98),
whose book, first published in 1828, has been fiercely attacked by Catholic
critics; and Lea, <cite>Sacerdotal Celibacy</cite> (2d ed., Boston, 1884); supplemented
by his <cite>History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in
the Latin Church</cite> (Philadelphia, 1896). The immorality of the mediæval
clergy is also described by Bouvet, <cite>De la confession et du célibat
des prêtres</cite> (Paris, 1845); Gage, <cite>Woman, Church, and State</cite> (Chicago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
1893); <i>idem</i>, an article under the same title in <cite>History of Woman Suffrage</cite>
(New York, 1881); Lecky, <cite>History of European Morals</cite> (3d ed.,
New York, 1881); and Huth in the third chapter of <cite>Marriage of Near
Kin</cite> (2d ed., London, 1887). For a later period the subject is dealt with
by Michelet, <cite>Le prêtre, la femme, et la familie</cite> (new ed., Paris, 1889); and
"A. F. R.," <cite>Betrachtungen über den Klerikal- und Mönchsgeist im neunzehnten
Jahrhundert</cite> (1805). In this connection see also Bucksisch, <i>De
apostolis uxoratis</i> (new ed., Wittenberg, 1734); Essich, <cite>De clericis maritis
dissertatio historica</cite> (Augusta Vindelicorum, 1747); Feyerabend, <cite>De

Celibacy of the Clergy</cite> (London, 1816); Zimmermann, <cite>Der Priester-Cölibat</cite>
(Kempten, 1899), presenting the loyal Catholic point of view;
and the monograph of Schulte, <cite>Der Cölibatszwang und dessen Aufhebung</cite>
(Bonn, 1876). A favorable view of the conventual life is taken by
Eckenstein, <cite>Woman under Monasticism</cite> (Cambridge, 1896); and curious
monuments of the contempt for woman produced by asceticism are the
books of Valens Acidalius and his adversary Simon Geddicus, mentioned
in a footnote below. For the controversy in France regarding the validity
of the marriage of a priest under the temporal law see Nachet, <cite>Liberté
du mariage des prêtres: Mémoire produit à la Cour de Cassation pour
M. Dumonteil</cite> (Paris, 1833); and Horoy, <cite>Du mariage civil du prêtre en
France</cite> (Paris, 1890).</p>

<p>The manifold evils arising from the canonical distinction between
<i>sponsalia de praesenti vel futuro</i> are best described in the vigorous
words of Martin Luther. In particular should be read the thirty-sixth
chapter of the <cite>Tischreden</cite> (folio, Frankfort, 1571), and the <cite>Von Ehesachen:
Werke</cite>, XXIII (Erlangen ed.) or Vol. V in <cite>Bücher und Schriften</cite>
(Jena, 1555-80). The quaint and learned book of Swinburne, <cite>Of Spousals</cite>
(London, 1686), contains a striking passage bearing on the subject;
while for the mediæval English law should be consulted Glanville's
<cite>Tractatus</cite>; Bracton's <cite>De Legibus</cite> (ed. Twiss, London, 1878-83); <i>idem</i>,
<cite>Note Book</cite> (ed. Maitland, London, 1887); and Maitland's <cite>Select Pleas
of the Crown</cite>. With Sohm's view as to the essential identity in form of
the two kinds of <i>sponsalia</i> compare the various works of Biener, Bierling,
Sehling, Scheurl, and Dieckhoff mentioned in Bibliographical Note
VII. The text of Master Vacarius's <cite>Summa de matrimonio</cite> is edited
by Maitland in <cite>Law Quarterly Review</cite>, XIII (London, 1897); and in the
same volume he discusses Vacarius's theory of marriage, differing essentially
from that of Gratian or Lombard. Assistance may also be had
from Weber, <cite>De vera inter sponsalia de praesenti et nuptias differentia</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
(Parchimi, 1825); Hoffmann, <cite>De aetate juvenili contrahendis

(Helmstadt, 1705); Born, <cite>De bannis nuptialibus</cite> (Leipzig,
1716); and the dissertations on parental consent and clandestine marriage
mentioned in Bibliographical Note IX.</p>

<p>Remarkable testimony as to the existence of clandestine marriage
in England during the first half of the sixteenth century is given by
Richard Whitforde, <cite>A Werke for householders</cite> (1530; 2d ed., 1537); and
in Miles Coverdale's translation of Bullinger's <cite>Christen State of Matrimonye</cite>
(1st ed., 1541, in British Museum).</p>

<p>Indispensable guides for the study of the entire subject are still the
works of Sohm, Friedberg, and Pollock and Maitland; but by far the best
systematic histories of canon-law marriage are Freisen's <cite>Geschichte des
canonischen Eherechts</cite> (Tübingen, 1888; Paderborn, 1893); and Esmein's
masterly <cite>Le mariage en droit canonique</cite> (Paris, 1891). A similar work
for the eastern church is Zhishman's <cite>Das Eherecht der orientalischen

1880). There is an article on the beginnings of ecclesiastical jurisdiction
by Sohm, "Die geistliche Gerichtsbarkeit im frankischen Reich," <i>ibid.</i>,
IX (Tübingen, 1870). Wunderlich has a serviceable edition of Tancred's

<h3>I. THE EARLY CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE AND THE RISE OF
THE CANONICAL THEORY</h3>

<p>It was most unfortunate for civilization that the Christian
conception of the nature of marriage should have sprung
from asceticism, and that the verbal subtlety of the schoolmen
should have produced the cardinal definitions upon
which the validity of marriage contracts, and therefore the
practical administration of matrimonial law, were made to
depend. The mediæval teaching regarding forbidden degrees,
the sacramental nature of matrimony, and the difference
between contracts <i>de futuro</i> and <i>de praesenti</i> are mainly
responsible for the shameful abuses which disgrace the
record of ecclesiastical judicature previous to the Council of
Trent. With regard to an institution upon which in so high
a degree the welfare of society depends, anarchy was practically
sanctioned by the canon law. Where the utmost
clearness and simplicity were needed, obscurity and complexity
prevailed; and where publicity was urgently required by
the plainest rule of common-sense, there secrecy was in effect
invited and rewarded.</p>

<p>The early church was only too ready to take in hand the
supervision of marriage and the development of matrimonial
law. With regard to the <i>form</i>, as already shown, her progress
was cautious and slow. Not until the thirteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
as a general rule, does the priest appear with authority as one
especially qualified by his religious office to solemnize the
nuptials. But long before this, in nearly every other respect
save only the betrothal, the church was taking sole possession
of the field of matrimonial law and jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> Yet
the institution of marriage was accepted, as it were, under
protest. Here and there, of course, the early Fathers admit
the purity of the marriage state,<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> but usually with a tone of
apology or depreciation which is itself very suggestive of the
pervading trend of the ascetic mind. If wedlock be holy,
celibacy is much more holy. "It is better to marry than to
burn," is a dictum which sounds the keynote of ecclesiastical
dogma. "Few texts," declare Pollock and Maitland, "have
done more harm than this. In the eyes of the mediæval
church marriage was a sacrament; still it was but a remedy
for fornication. The generality of men and women must
marry or they will do worse; therefore marriage must be
made easy; but the very pure hold aloof from it as from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
defilement. The law that springs from this source is not
pleasant to read."<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a></p>

<p>Here we have a double paradox, two irreconcilable contradictions,
which in due time produced their natural evil
fruit. On the one hand, marriage is a sacrament, a holy
mystery, yet it rests upon a mere human contract.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> On the
other hand, though possessing a sacramental character, it is
but a compromise with lust, from which the saint may well
abstain. Hence a premium is placed upon sacerdotal celibacy,
though for centuries priests are not absolutely forbidden
to marry. Thus in England, at any rate until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
days of Dunstan, celibacy had not been strictly enforced in
the monastic bodies;<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> and until a still later day marriage was
practiced by the secular clergy,<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> the priestly office in some
instances practically becoming hereditary, passing on from
father to son.<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> But in the western church asceticism at last
gained a complete victory; and the priest taking orders after
marriage was obliged to put away his wife; while in both
East and West marriage after the taking of orders was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> The causes of the low esteem in which marriage
was held by the early Christian theologians have been
well described by Meyrick. "For some time before the
Christian era a change of sentiment as to the relative excellence
of the married and single life had been growing up
among a section of the Jews. The national feeling was
strongly in favour of marriage, and a man who was unmarried
or without children was looked upon as disgraced. But
the spirit of asceticism, cherished by the Essenes, led to an
admiration of celibacy, of which no traces are to be found
in the Old Testament; so that, instead of a shame, it became
an honour to be unmarried and childless. In the early
church this spirit, at first exhibiting itself only to be condemned
in the Encratites," and some other sects, "struggled
with a healthier feeling, till at length it stifled the latter.
But another cause was working in the same direction. The
days of chivalry were not yet; and we cannot but notice,
even in the greatest of the Christian fathers, a lamentably
low estimate of woman, and consequently of the marriage
relationship. Even St. Augustine can see no justification
for marriage, except in a grave desire deliberately adopted
of having children."<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> If "marriage is sought after for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
sake of children, it is justifiable; if entered into as a
<i>remedium</i> to avoid worse evils, it is pardonable; the idea of
'the mutual society, help, and comfort, that the one ought to
have of the other, both in prosperity and adversity,' hardly
existed and could hardly yet exist.<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> In the decline of the
Roman empire, woman was not a helpmeet for man, and few
traces are to be found of those graceful conceptions which
western imagination has grouped round wedded love and
home affections. The result was that the gross, coarse,
material, carnal side of marriage being alone apprehended,
those who sought to lead a spiritual life, that is, above all,
the clergy, instead of 'adorning and beautifying that holy
estate' and lifting it up with themselves into a higher sphere
and purer atmosphere, regarded it rather as a necessary evil
to be shunned by those who aimed at a holier life than that
of the majority."<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<p>But, in spite of theology and priestly asceticism, there is
little doubt that the loftier ideals and the gentler affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
which we now associate with wedded life were beginning to
make themselves felt in the early Christian family; just as
despite the licentiousness found in the imperial and noble
circles of the capital, most observed and doubtless exaggerated
by historian and satirist, and notwithstanding the
surviving coldness<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> of the patriarchal age, the same ideas
and sentiments, independently of Christian influences, must
already have been springing up among the common people
of the provinces, and presently in the Stoic families of the
Antonine era were to reach a splendid development worthy
of the days in which we live.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> It is doubtless true, as so
often urged, that there is a bright side to the history of celibacy.
Incidentally the monk organized schools, taught the
barbarous tribes the dignity of labor, demonstrated the power
of industry,<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> and handed down to the men of the Renaissance
some of the materials of classic learning. So, likewise, the
convent afforded an outlet for the energy and the ambition of
woman. Here in a large measure she enjoyed independence
and could assert her individuality. "For the convent
accepted the dislike women felt to domestic subjection and
countenanced them in their refusal to undertake the duties
of married life." The "outward conditions of life were such
that the woman who joined the convent made her decision
once for all. But provided she agreed to forego the claims
of family and sex, an honorable independence was secured to
her, and she was brought into contact with the highest aims
of her age. At a period when monasteries, placed in the
remote and uncultivated districts, radiated peace and civilization
throughout the neighborhood, many women devoted
themselves to managing settlements which, in the standard
they attained, vied in excellence with the settlements managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
by men." "The career open to the inmates of convents
both in England and on the continent," continues Eckenstein,
in summarizing the results of her valuable researches, "was
greater than any other ever thrown open to women in the
course of modern European history."<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> Still, granting all
that can be said for the conventual life, the motives which
sustained it only throw into bolder relief the social evils of
the age and the low ideal of marriage fostered by asceticism
itself. History all too plainly shows that the benefits conferred
by monasticism and the enforced celibacy of the secular
clergy come far short of balancing the evils flowing from
the conception of wedlock as a "remedy for concupiscence."
The influence of the church did, indeed, tend to condemn
the breach of conjugal fidelity by the husband as equally sinful
with that of the wife; although this righteous principle
has by no means always been observed in Christian legislation.
On the other hand, celibacy bred a contempt for
womanhood and assailed the integrity of the family.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
gross immorality of the mediaeval clergy, regular and secular,
and the shocking abuses of the confessional have often

<p>We may next consider the second member of the paradox,
the dogma which constitutes the very basis of the canon
law of marriage and the source of manifold hardships and
confusion. By the second half of the twelfth century the
doctrine that marriage is a sacrament was thoroughly established
in the western church.<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> The early Christian teachers
had, indeed, regarded it as one of the many holy "mysteries"
to which the name "sacrament" was given.<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> But it was long
before any of these were differentiated as distinct rites superior
to the rest in religious efficacy. Not until 1164, in the
fourth book of Peter Lombard's <i>Sentences</i>, do we find the
first clear recognition of the "seven sacraments," among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
which that of marriage appears;<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> and these were approved
by The Council of Florence in 1439 and later by the Council
of Trent.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> The theory of the sacramental character of wedlock
had two consequences of vast importance for the history
of matrimonial law. First is the dogma of the indissolubility
of the marriage bond, involving the whole problem of
separation and divorce, which must be reserved for discussion
in another chapter;<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> and, second, the exclusive jurisdiction
of the church in matrimonial causes.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> This ecclesiastical
function, like so many others, is of slow growth. "We are
here confronted by a conception which certainly does not
belong to the primitive sources. It is not by a revindication
of principles that the church conquers jurisdiction in marriage.
After having shared it with the state for centuries,
she obtained it in the Middle Ages without partition;" and
"when her competence was well established and a theory
for it was required, it was justified by saying that the church
alone could take cognizance of sacraments;" and "at the
Council of Trent when this jurisdiction was solemnly affirmed
in a canon sanctioned by anathema, the majority of the
orators brought it expressly into connection with the sacrament."<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>
In England between the seventh and the twelfth
centuries the ecclesiastical authority in matrimonial questions
was slowly established. Gregory writes to Augustine
concerning forbidden degrees.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> Later Theodore regulates
marriage and divorce.<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> "When the conqueror had paid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
debt that he owed to Rome by a definite separation of the
spiritual from the lay tribunals,<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> it cannot have remained
long in doubt that the former would claim the whole province
of marriage law as their own. In all probability this claim
was not suddenly pressed; the <i>leges Henrici</i><a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> endeavor to
state the old law about adultery; the man's fine goes to the
king, the woman's to the bishop; but everywhere the church
was beginning to urge that claim, and the canonists were
constructing an elaborate jurisprudence of marriage. By
the middle of the twelfth century, by the time when Gratian
was compiling his concordance of discordant canons, it was
law in England that marriage appertained to the spiritual
forum."<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> From the time of Glanville the "marriage law of
England was the canon law."<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a></p>



<p>The theories adopted and developed by the canonists
favor the forming of marriages. "All those are urged to
marry who are unable to bear the superior state of virginity
or continence and who are not restrained by solemn vows."
Consequently the canon law "renders the formation of marriage
as easy as it had rendered its dissolution difficult."<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>
At first, as already explained, it adopted the Roman betrothal,
which possessed no legal significance, the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
beginning with the nuptials or actual living together. Later
it accepted the principles of Germanic custom, according to
which the legal effects of betrothal became far more stringent,
and the marriage was perfected at the nuptials or tradition,
and not through the <i>Beilager</i>, or physical union. Hence by
the mediæval canon law, if the nuptials were solemnized by
priestly benediction, though not followed by <i>copula</i> or physical
union, a marriage was formed which could not be annulled
by means of subsequent espousals thus consummated.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a>
Gradually, however, as the betrothal gained, the nuptials
lost, in importance. Before the middle of the twelfth century
the doctrine prevailed that the <i>copula carnalis</i> is
the supreme legal moment in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> This theory, which
had arisen with Hincmar of Rheims,<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> is especially associated
with the name of Gratian, in whose <i>Decretum</i> the arguments
for and against it are weighed, with the result of its
practical acceptance, though he tries to reconcile it with the
Roman view, that the nuptial <i>consensus</i> constitutes the marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>
According to him, there are two degrees in marriage:
one is the <i>conjugium initiatum</i>, arising in the simple
consent of the espoused; second, the <i>conjugium ratum</i>,
created by the <i>copula carnalis</i> and perfecting the former.
The <i>conjugium initiatum</i> may be dissolved at pleasure; but
the <i>conjugium ratum</i> is indissoluble. Thus the former is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
merely the Roman betrothal under another name. But the
Bolognese jurists made it more stringent, assigning eight
reasons for which alone such a marriage could be dissolved.<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a></p>

<p>The theory of the classic canon law, formulated by Gratian,
that there is no marriage "until man and woman have
been one flesh,"<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> does not receive so much emphasis in any
other legal system.<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> It had far-reaching consequences in
matrimonial jurisprudence.<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> Marriage became a simple
consensual compact. "In strictness of law all that was
essential was this physical union accompanied by the intent
to be thenceforth husband and wife. All that preceded this
could be no more than an espousal (<i>desponsatio</i>) and the
relationship between the spouses was one which was dissoluble;
in particular it was dissolved if either of them contracted
a perfected marriage with a third person."<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a></p>

<p>But before the close of the twelfth century theological
subtlety had conceived and gained the acceptance of a distinction
in the forms of contract which was fatal to the
security of the marriage bond. The famous classification
of contracts as <i>sponsalia per verba de praesenti</i> and <i>sponsalia
per verba de futuro</i>, though its principle was earlier
asserted, is due mainly to Peter Lombard;<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> and through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
influence of Alexander III. ("Magister Rolandus") it was
accepted generally by the western church.<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> The theory of
Lombard represents the triumph of Gallic theology over
the doctrine of Gratian, as maintained by the Italian jurists;
and, in effect, it is an attempt to combine the principles of
the Roman with those of the German&mdash;that is to say, the
canonical&mdash;betrothal.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> In <i>sponsalia de praesenti</i>, in words
of the present tense, the man and woman declare that they
take each other now, from this moment onward, as husband
and wife. Such a contract is a valid marriage, though not
followed by actual wedded union; and since in theory it is
a real marriage, it is necessarily sacramental in character.
It creates a bond which can be dissolved only with the
greatest difficulty. It constitutes "at all events an initiate
marriage; the spouses are <i>coniuges</i>; the relationship between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
them is almost as indisseverable as if it had already become
a consummate marriage. Not quite so indisseverable however;
a spouse may free himself or herself from the unconsummated
marriage by entering religion, and such a marriage
is within the papal power of dispensation."<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> But even
the unconsummate marriage <i>de praesenti</i> cannot be dissolved
by a subsequent marriage which either party may contract,
though followed by wedded union.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> Espousals <i>de futuro</i>, on
the other hand, are a promise for future joining in marriage.
Physical union when preceded by such a contract is held to
constitute a binding marriage. The canonists went farther
than this, as Esmein declares, and "in a way set a snare for
human nature to beguile the imprudent into the matrimonial
state" through the theory of "presumptive marriage." The
<i>copula carnalis</i> was made a legal ground for assuming the
foregoing promise to wed. "The rule was laid down that it
is always necessary to judge in favor of marriage unless the
contrary be clearly understood."<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> Moreover, the church
steadily refused to make the validity of marriage depend
upon forms and conditions such as the civil law prescribes.
There was no absolute requirement of parental consent<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of a certain age. All persons on reaching the years of
puberty were declared capable of wedlock solely on their
own authority. No religious ceremony, no record, or witness
was essential. The private, even secret, agreement of the
betrothed, however expressed, was declared sufficient for a
valid contract.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> All these things might be enjoined under
sanction of severe discipline for their neglect; but the marriage,
if formed without them, was not the less binding. A
puzzling and disastrous antagonism between <em>legality</em> and
<em>validity</em> was thus created. Even the Council of Trent,
while making the validity of the marriage depend upon its
conclusion in the presence of a priest and two or three
witnesses, declined to go farther and give an equal sanction
to banns, registration, or the benediction, though these
were enjoined in its decree. After the council as well as
before children barely arrived at the age of puberty might
contract a valid marriage without the consent, or even
against the will, of their parents.<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> In short, as Esmein
has so well shown, lest without a safety-valve the temptations
of the flesh should become too strong for weak
human nature, and lest access to a sacrament should be
hindered, it was deemed necessary to discard all restraints
originating in mere "human convention."<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> It is a noteworthy
fact that the dogma of marriage as a sacrament
came near being a fatal obstacle in the way of the action
of the Council of Trent against secret marriages.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> For
how could the church legislate concerning a holy mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
which Christ himself had given her, without suggesting
the human nature of the matrimonial contract and by
implication admitting the right of the state to exercise a
similar control? But even in this domain her exclusive
jurisdiction was affirmed.</p>


<h3>II. CLANDESTINE MARRIAGES THE FRUIT OF THE
CANONICAL THEORY</h3>

<p>The way was thus cleared for clandestine marriages. All
efficient restraints upon hasty unions were rejected; and
often it became impossible for the courts or even the parties
themselves to know whether a man and a woman were legally
husband and wife or their children legitimate. Seldom have
mere theory and subtle quibbling had more disastrous consequences
in practical life than in the case of the distinction
between <i>sponsalia de praesenti</i> and <i>de futuro</i>. The difference
was not essential, but purely verbal.<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> The canonist had
before his mind the tense inflections of a Latin verb. He
insisted on a distinction which found no place in popular
ideas and which the usages of popular speech refused to observe.
In the English as well as the German idiom the contrast
between the present and the future tense is not always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
sharply defined.<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> This anomaly is described by Martin
Luther in his usual trenchant style. "They have played a
regular fool's game," he says, "with their <i>verbis de praesenti
vel futuro</i>. With it they have torn apart many marriages
which were valid according to their own law, and those which
were not valid they have bound up.... Indeed I should
not myself know how a churl ... would or could betroth
himself <i>de futuro</i> in the German tongue; for the way one
betroths himself means <i>per verba de praesenti</i>, and surely
a clown knows nothing of such nimble grammar as the difference
between <i>accipio</i> and <i>accipiam</i>; therefore he proceeds
according to our way of speech and says: 'I will have thee,'
'I will take thee,' 'thou shalt be mine.' Thereupon 'yes' is
said at once without more ado."<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p>That German rustics were not the only lovers caught in
the meshes of grammatical forms appears from the following
passage written toward the close of the Tudor period by
Swinburne, who nevertheless defends the canonical distinction,
whether the contract be made in the Latin or in the
vulgar tongue.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> After refuting, as he believes, the reasoning
of those who hold that the forms "I will take thee to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
wife" ("<i>Ego volo te accipere in uxorem</i>") and "I do take
thee to my wife" ("<i>Ego accipio te in uxorem</i>") are equally
a contract in the present tense, he proceeds to attack the
argument "drawn from the Simplicity of the Vulgar sort, who
albeit they intend to tye such a Knot as can never be loosed,
and make the Contract so sure as it may never be dissolved;
yet such is their unskilfulness and ignorance herein, that
they cannot frame their words to their minds, nor know
whether it be all one to say 'I will take thee to my wife' or
'I do take thee to my wife,' much less do they know the
difference betwixt these words, 'I will marry thee' and 'I
will have thee to my wife,' or betwixt these words, 'I will
take thee to my wife' and 'I will hold thee for my wife,' or
betwixt these words, 'I will espouse thee' and 'I will intreat
thee as my wife,' or betwixt these words, 'I will Contract
Matrimony with thee' and 'I will provide for thee as my
Wife,' or betwixt these words, 'I will make thee my wife' and
'thou shalt be my Wife,' with an hundred such differences
wherein appeareth no dissimilitude. And therefore, since it
is the very Consent of Mind only which maketh Matrimony,
we are to regard not their Words, but their Intents, not the
formality of the Phrase, but the drift of their Determination,
not the outward sound of their Lips, which cannot speak
more cunningly, but the inward Harmony or Agreement of
their Hearts, which mean uprightly." Otherwise, especially
in case of people of the "ruder sort, whose Sayings are to
be expounded with all favour to the furtherance of Matrimony,"
if "we shall curiously descant upon every word proceeding
from a simple Conceit, we cannot but miss of their
meanings, and with our fine and dainty Distinctions (which
never came within the compass of their gross Understandings)
incumber the Consciences of them which be coupled....
Lest therefore any Man's Conscience (through ignorance
of Terms) might be intangled in the Snares of this subtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and more captious Distinction of 'I will' and 'I do' with the
rest of the Differences more subtle and more captious, ...
are the same to be rejected, and this reasonable and conscionable
Conclusion received ... where two intend to
Contract Spousals <i>de praesenti</i>, there is Matrimony always
contracted, although the words import but future Consent
only."<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> Time has approved the soundness of this plea, in
spite of the remonstrance of Swinburne and the logic of the
worthy doctors whom he cites.</p>

<p>Scholastic hairsplitting had set a veritable trap for the
feet of the unwary. "Of all people in the world lovers are
the least likely to distinguish precisely between the present
and the future tenses. In the Middle Ages marriages, or
what looked like marriages, were exceedingly insecure. The
union which had existed for many years between man and
woman might with fatal ease be proved adulterous, and there
would be hard swearing on both sides about 'I will' and 'I
do.'"<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> Accordingly the ecclesiastical courts were given a
dangerous power<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>&mdash;a perilous discretion in matrimonial
causes, which, however wisely exercised, was sure to work
much hardship and injustice. Since in substance espousals
<i>de praesenti</i> and <i>de futuro</i> were identical, differing only in
the consequences which the law attached to the tense form, it
was inevitable that decisions should be arbitrary and wavering;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
and, as a matter of fact, practically the same form of
contract was held at one time to constitute <i>sponsalia de
praesenti</i>; at another, a promise <i>de futuro</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> and the <i>Liber
officialis</i> of St. Andrews, Scotland, contains the record of a
divorce granted from a second union because the man had
already contracted a previous marriage in these words: "I
promyth to yow Begis Abirnethy that I sall mary yow,
and that I sall neuere haiff ane uther wiff and therto I
giff yow my fayth." It is a striking illustration of the entanglements
resulting from the canonical theory that this
contract is styled in the record "<i>both sponsalia de futuro</i>
and <i>praesenti</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> The worst of it was that the spiritual
salvation or damnation of the man and woman, the genuineness
of whose union was in question, depended upon the
decision. The valid marriage was no less a sacrament,
though dissolved through ignorance, error, or perjury; and
the invalid marriage was no more a sacrament, though in
the same way declared binding. For by a rule of the spiritual
courts, in a suit growing out of a secret marriage, the
plaintiff who affirmed the validity of the espousals, if the
fact were denied by the defendant, had to prove his allegation.
If he failed to do so&mdash;and this might easily happen,
since often the espousals were formless and absolutely without
witness<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>&mdash;the case was dismissed, the contract dissolved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and the parties were free to form new marriages elsewhere.
But if the secret marriage were after all really valid, and
therefore a sacrament, though not sustained for lack of
proof, the husband and wife were still bound in their consciences;
and if either should form a second union with
another person, though it were publicly solemnized in face
of the church, he would be guilty of the sin of bigamy.<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>
To the existence of this cruel embarrassment Luther bears
witness in a characteristic passage of his <cite>Tischreden</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> "Now
the pope and the jurists say that marriage may never be
dissolved. What happens? The wedded people fall out and
separate. So they come to me in the cloister or wherever
an official can be found and swear themselves apart; then
they marry again. Thereafter they come to me or to some
confessor and say: Dear sir, I have now a wife whom I
espoused secretly. What am I to do about it? Help me,
dear Doctor, lest I despair. For Greta whom I first married
is my proper wife. But this Barbara whom I espoused
later is not my wife, and yet must I not sleep with her?

<p>The evil of clandestine marriages prevailed generally
throughout Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> The provincial church councils
as well as the temporal powers, local and national, were kept
busy in devising penalties or other restraints in the vain hope
of putting a stop to it. Such was the case in Holland, where,
in spite of the decrees of the church and the statutes of the
state, secret marriages, without the presence of witness,
magistrate, or priest, were common.<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> The same is true of

Ages, that even the innocent were deterred from appealing
to the courts to enforce their matrimonial rights. Before

already pointed out, that the permanence or dissolution of
such a marriage really depends upon the will of the parties
themselves, or even one of them. "Three kinds of marriage
are called 'secret;' the first is one concluded privately and
without witnesses, so that it cannot be proved. The second
is one formed before witnesses, but without the consent of
the bride's father, or mother, or other relative in whose protection
she is, and without payment of the arrha or observing
the other forms (honors) which holy church demands. The
third is one whose banns have not been published in the
parish where the parties live.... The reason why the
holy church forbids secret marriages is this: When a difference
arises between the wedded pair, and the one will no
longer live with the other, the church has no means to prevent
the separation, even when in truth a marriage exists;
because it cannot be proved. For the church cannot pass
judgment on secrets; but only on the allegations of the
parties which are proved."<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a></p>

<p>Nowhere perhaps is the history of secret marriages so

Usually the nuptials were celebrated in presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
a priest at the church door according to popular forms, or,
in the later period, according to more elaborate religious
rites. But by custom the simple hand-fasting, with or without
giving to the bride a penny or piece of gold, sufficed;
and the hand-fasting is found also in connection with the
ecclesiastical ceremony. Even in the case of secret marriages
"it is characteristic that mention is almost always
made of the presence of a priest who confers his blessing."<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>

passage:</p>

<p>"Yet in thys thynge also must I warne everye reasonable
&amp; honest parson to beware, that in contractyng of maryage
they dyssemble not, nor set forthe any lye. Every man lykewyse

be not done in the church nor in the streate. After the hand
fasting &amp; makyng of the contracte, the church goyng &amp; weddyng

<h3>III. THE EVILS OF THE SPIRITUAL JURISDICTION</h3>

<p>The separation of the temporal and spiritual courts and
the tenacity with which early custom and theory were preserved
in the common law<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> render the history of matrimonial
judicature anomalous in England. The leading case occurs
in the reign of Stephen. "Richard de Anesty's memorable
law-suit<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> was the outcome of a divorce pronounced in 1143
under the authority of a papal rescript, and one that to all
appearance illustrated what was to be a characteristic doctrine
of the canon law: a marriage solemnly celebrated in
church, a marriage of which a child had been born, was set
aside as null in favour of an earlier marriage constituted
by a mere exchange of consenting words."<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> By the time
of Henry II. this doctrine was completely established in
England, as shown by the famous decretal epistle of Alexander
III. to the bishop of Norwich: "A strong case is put.
On the one hand stands the bare consent <i>per verba de
praesenti</i>, unhallowed and unconsummated, on the other a
solemn and a consummated union. The latter must yield to
the former."<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> Such remained the law of England until the
passage of the Hardwicke act in 1753.<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a></p>

<p>The perils arising in the canonical theory of espousals
were greatly increased by the doctrine of impediments to
marriage, particularly those growing out of forbidden degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of affinity, consanguinity, and spiritual relationship.<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> "Reckless
of mundane consequences, the church while she treated
marriage as a formless contract, multiplied impediments
which made the formation of a valid marriage a matter of
chance."<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> The stringency of the law in this regard appears
to be entirely inconsistent with the theory that marriage
should be encouraged. But doubtless the apparent contradiction
is due largely to the same ideas which shaped
that theory. The Fathers dreaded the sins of the flesh
through which the sacramental nature of marriage might
be defiled;<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> and they may have felt a reaction against the
freedom of the German custom touching the marriage of
blood kindred.<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></p>

<p>The development of the law of forbidden degrees, through
the doctrines of the early Christian teachers and a long series
of conciliar decrees, cannot here be described. In the thirteenth
century the various rules were codified by the schoolmen
under fifteen heads; "and their code has been accepted
and acted upon by the greater part of western Christendom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
down to the present day."<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> For a time prohibition was
extended to the seventh degree of consanguinity, counting,
as did the canonists, in the collateral line, <em>from</em> the common
ancestor and not <em>through</em> the same according to the Roman
method.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> A distinction, however, was made. Kinship in
the sixth or seventh degree was held to be only "<i>impedimentum
impediens</i>, a reason for a refusal to solemnize a
marriage, not <i>impedimentum dirimens</i>, a cause which would
render a marriage null;" and this doctrine was "received in
England as well as elsewhere."<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> At the Lateran council of
1215 Innocent III. adopted the rule that "marriages within
the fourth degree of consanguinity are forbidden and null."<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>
But the doctrines of the church touching affinity and relationship
did not therefore cease to perplex the courts, molest
the happiness of individuals, and threaten the tranquillity of
nations.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> In England the perennial "deceased wife's sister"
bill, the stubborn resistance to which has so long attested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the amazing tenacity of theological prejudice, has not even
yet successfully run the gauntlet of the House of Lords.<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p>The relation of the temporal to the spiritual courts in the
administration of English matrimonial law was anomalous.<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>
Strictly speaking, there was no lay jurisdiction whatever
with regard to the genuineness of marriage. Only the
ecclesiastical judge could determine whether a valid marriage
existed.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> In such a case the jury could not "declare the
right." The question was referred to the spiritual court for
decision. On the other hand, the law tribunal, without aid
of the spiritual judge, could say whether or not there was a
<i>de facto</i> marriage as opposed to a marriage <i>de jure</i>. The
jury could determine, in a possessory action, whether there
had been a public ceremony in face of the church. This
was a decisive proof; for the mere fact of living together as
husband and wife was not always conclusive.<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> "If a man
and woman have gone through the ceremony of marriage at
the church door, we may say that we have here a <i>de facto</i>
marriage, a union which stands to a valid marriage in somewhat
the same relation as that in which possession stands to
ownership. On the other hand, if there has been no ceremony,
we cannot in the thirteenth century say that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
a <i>de facto</i> marriage; mere concubinage, especially among
the clergy, is far too common to allow us to presume a marriage
wherever there is a long-continued cohabitation. But
a religious ceremony is a different thing; it is definite and
public; we can trust the jurors to know all about it; we can
make it the basis of our judgments whenever the validity of
the union has not been put in issue in such a fashion that
the decision of an ecclesiastical court must be awaited."<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a></p>

<p>The practical application of this doctrine appears in the
two cases of divorce and inheritance. Here the temporal
courts tried indirectly to put a check upon clandestine marriages,
to remedy the evils resulting from the scholastic
dogma that mere consent secretly expressed in words of the
present tense constitutes a valid marriage, by making the
acquisition of certain property rights depend upon the publicity
of the espousals.<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> The widow could not receive her
dower unless it had been publicly assigned at the nuptials
before the church door.<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> "The result is curious, for at first
sight the lay tribunal seems to be rigidly requiring a religious
ceremony which in the eyes of the church is unessential....
We soon see, however, that what our justices
are demanding is, not a religious rite nor 'the presence of
an ordained clergyman,' but publicity.... Marriages
contracted elsewhere may be valid enough, but only at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
church door can a bride be endowed. There is a special
reason for this requirement. The common-law contrast to
the church-door marriage is the death-bed marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> At
the instance of the priest and with the fear of death before
him, the sinner 'makes an honest woman' of his mistress.
This may do well enough for the church, and may, one
hopes, profit his soul in another world, but it must give no
rights in English soil."<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> So also with regard to inheritance,
in certain cases,<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> the lay court made the rights of children
depend upon public solemnization of the nuptials, thus
adopting the canonical theory of "putative marriages."<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>
Although there may be no valid marriage on account of the
existence of certain impediments, such as too near kinship,
the children are nevertheless legitimate if the nuptials were
publicly celebrated at the church door, and if at least one
of the parents, at the time the children were begotten, was
"ignorant of the fact which constituted the impediment."
They are entitled to inheritance, though the parents are not
really husband and wife. On this point in the thirteenth
century church and state were at one;<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> but later a less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
liberal doctrine was adopted by the secular tribunals. "The
ultimate theory of the English lawyers took no heed of good
or bad faith, and made the legitimacy of the children depend
on the fact that their parents while living were never
divorced."<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></p>

<p>The refusal of the church to prescribe a proper age condition
for those entering matrimony led, as might be expected,
to child marriages; and in this case the rules of the English
common law only tended to magnify the evil. By the
canonists the age of consent to marriage was fixed at seven
years.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> Thereafter a marriage formed without consent of
parent or guardian, and even in opposition to it, was held
to be legal; but it was "voidable so long as either of the
parties to it was below the age at which it could be consummated.
A presumption fixed this age at fourteen years for
boys and twelve years for girls. In case only one of the
parties was below that age, the marriage could be avoided
by that party but was binding on the other. So far as we
can see, this doctrine was accepted by our temporal courts."<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
By the teaching of the common lawyers a widow of nine
years of age at her husband's death could claim dower,
though the marriage would have been voidable by her at
the age of puberty.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> The English temporal courts appear
to have disregarded the canonical rule that a marriage is absolutely
void when formed below the age of seven. "Coke
tells us that the nine years old widow shall have her dower
'of what age soever her husband be, albeit he were but four
years old,' and certain it is that the betrothal of babies was
not consistently treated as a nullity. In Henry III.'s day
marriage between a boy of four or five years and a girl who
was no older seems capable of ratification, and as a matter
of fact parents and guardians often betrothed, or attempted
to betroth, children who were less than seven years old.
Even the church could say no more than that babies in the
cradle were not to be given in marriage, except under the
pressure of some urgent need."<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> For such infant marriages,
however, there were two practical motives during the Middle
Ages. In England, just as in India and often among lower
races,<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> the betrothal or espousal of very young children was

<h3>IV. PUBLICITY SOUGHT THROUGH BANNS AND REGISTRATION</h3>

<p>Without doubt the wrong and confusion arising in the
ecclesiastical theory and definition of marriage were manifold,h3
and they were patent to every observer. At the Council
of Trent it was asserted that some action to put a check
upon clandestine marriages was demanded by all the temporal
powers;<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> and the provincial church councils, aided by
state legislation, had done what they could by imposing;
penalties to remedy the abuse.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> Nevertheless, strange as
it may seem to one not acquainted with the devious logic
of scholastic theology, many members of the Council of
Trent, on dogmatic grounds, were stubbornly opposed to
the only reform which experience showed could be effective.
They affirmed that severer discipline would suffice. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
apologized for clandestine marriages on the pretext that
they are sometimes useful, even necessary; or they denied
that to declare them null would prove an efficient remedy.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></p>

<p>Hence we are better able to appreciate at its true value
the significance for the Catholic world of the victory gained
by the common-sense of the majority. It was a victory in
favor of that publicity which the state demanded. Indeed,
the church had already done something, in spite of dogma,
to change marriage from a private to a public transaction.
Her collision with the state, her anomalous position with
respect to social order, was involuntary. She was caught,
as it were, in the meshes of her own philosophy. Yet in the
interest of morality she strove to secure publicity. The
priest at the nuptials, declares Sohm, "appears first of all
as a public person."<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> In particular the church tried to
gain publicity for marriage by the institution of banns.
The custom of publishing banns seems first to have made
its appearance in France, probably as early as the fifth century.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a>
It is enforced by the capitulary of 802, which gains
its real significance from this fact, and not from the mention
of the priestly benediction.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> From France it gradually made
its way into other countries of Europe. Thus in the year
1200, as already noted, banns were enforced by Archbishop
Walter; and they were first made a general requirement by
Innocent III. at the fourth Lateran council in 1215.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> Later
the English archbishops found it necessary from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
time to impose more stringent penalties for neglect of the
proper publication of banns;<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> and they were enforced, without
making the publication essential to a valid marriage, by
the Council of Trent. From the twelfth century onward
the marriage rituals contain directions for the asking and
publication of banns;<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> while the punishment of persons
guilty of violating the canons in this regard gave much
employment to the spiritual courts during the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a></p>

<p>The institution of banns has a special historical interest
as being in some sense the mediæval substitute for the modern
registration and official license to wed. The practice
was to announce the marriage, usually on three successive
Sundays preceding the nuptials, that any objection on the
ground of relationship or other disability might be brought
forward. But the decrees of the church were not carefully
enforced. Dispensation from the obligation to publish
banns was the right of the bishop, but his license was
usually granted only in favor of the nobility and higher
classes; and the right constituted an important source of
revenue.<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a></p>

<p>The year 1538 marks an important epoch in the administration
of English matrimonial law. It was then, according
to the researches of Burn, that parish registers of births,
deaths, and marriages were first introduced; although before
this time it had been customary in some places to inscribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
such records in the missals and psalters of the church.<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> The
first article of the injunctions issued by Thomas Cromwell,
vice-regent under Henry VIII., provided: "<i>Item</i>, That you
and every parson, vicar, or curate within this Diocese, for
every Church keep one Book or Register, wherein he shall
write the day and year of every Wedding, Christening, and
Burial, made within your parish for your time, and so every
man succeeding you likewise, and also there insert every
person's name, that shall be so wedded, christened, and
buried. And for the safe keeping of the same Book the
parish shall be bound to provide of their common charges
one sure coffer, with two locks and keys, whereof the one to
remain with you, and the other with the Wardens of every
parish wherein the said Book shall be laid up, which Book
ye shall every Sunday take forth, and in the presence of the
said Wardens or one of them, write and record in the same,
all the Weddings, Christenings, and Burials made the whole
week afore, and that done, to lay up the Book in the said
coffer as afore; and for every time that the same shall be
omitted, the party that shall be in the fault thereof, shall forfeit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
to the said Church iij<sup>s</sup>. iiij<sup>d</sup>. to be employed on the reparation
of the said Church."<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a></p>

<p>Thus in this, the most ancient English registration act,
the parson or incumbent appears as the original registrar;
and that the importance of keeping such record was keenly
appreciated is shown by the anxious, almost painful, minuteness
with which his duties are defined. The order of Henry
VIII. was enforced or supplemented under Edward VI.,
Elizabeth, William III., and other monarchs; but, save
during the Commonwealth, no material change was made in
the mode of registration until in 1836 the present system
was introduced.<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

THE PROTESTANT CONCEPTION OF MARRIAGE</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note IX.</span>&mdash;The ideas of the German Reformation,
and therefore ultimately of Protestantism, relative to the form
and the nature of marriage were molded by the thought of Martin
Luther. Among his numerous writings on the subject most important
are the "Vom heiligen Ehestandt und Oeconomia oder Haushaltung,"
being the thirty-sixth chapter of the <cite>Tischreden</cite> (folio, Frankfort, 1571);
and the following articles in his <cite>Bücher und Schriften</cite> (folio, Jena,
1555-80): "Sermon vom ehelichen Stande" (1519, in Vol. I); "Predigten
über das erste Buch Mose" (1527, in Vol. IV); and especially the "Von
Ehesachen" (1530, in Vol. V). The principal passages from all of
Luther's writings on the subject of matrimony and divorce, classified
in seven groups, with critical and historical notes and marginal explanation
of archaic words, are conveniently given in von Strampff's <cite>Dr.
Martin Luther: Ueber die Ehe</cite> (Berlin, 1857). This is an important
<i>Quellenbuch</i> for the student. A very useful book also, containing
twelve of his most important papers, is the second volume of the
<cite>Kleinere Schriften Dr. Martin Luthers</cite>, entitled "Von Ehe- und
Klostersachen" (Bielefeld and Leipzig, 1877). Older works which
afford some assistance are Niess's <cite>Ehestands-Buch</cite> (Eisleben and Leipzig,
1858), comprising, with other matter, some of the utterances of
Luther; and Froböse's <cite>Dr. Martin Luther's ernste, kräftige Worte
über Ehe und eheliche Verhältnisse</cite> (Hanover, 1825).</p>

<p>The first philosophical treatise on marriage, anticipating in various
ways the modern conception, is Erasmus's <cite>Christiani matrimonii institutio</cite>
(Basel, 1526). The dedicatory epistle, dated July, 1526, is addressed
to Queen Catherine of England. The edition cited in the text bears the
general title <cite>De matrimonio christiano</cite> (Lugd. Bat., 1650); and to it is
appended Vivus's <cite>Conjugii origine et utilitate discursus</cite>. Erasmus's
treatise may also be found in Vol. V of his <cite>Opera omnia</cite> (Lugd. Bat.,
1704). The work was prohibited mainly because of its critical tone
regarding the excessive ardor of the primitive Christians for celibacy
and perpetual virginity. Of first-rate importance for obtaining a general
view of the doctrines of the German Reformation is Sarcerius, <cite>Vom
heiligen Ehestande</cite> (1553); or the same work enlarged under title <cite>Corpus
juris matrimonialis</cite> (Frankfort, 1569). It has been found convenient to
relegate the description of many writings available as sources for this
chapter to Bibliographical Note XI. See particularly the works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Brenz, Kling, Beust, Schneidewin, Melanchthon, Zwingli, Bullinger,
Bucer, Monner, Bidembach, Mentzer, Brouwer, and Forster, there
referred to. Besides Melanchthon's "De conjugio" (1551), in <cite>Opera</cite>, I
(Erlangen, 1828), see also his "De arbore consanguinitatis et affinitatis"
(1541), in Sarcerius, <cite>Vom heiligen Ehestande</cite>, lvs. xii-xxvii; or the
"Corpus juris matrimonialis," lvs. xi-xxvii, where may also be found
much additional matter from Luther, Kling, and others relating to forbidden
degrees. In this connection may also be consulted Niemeier,
<cite>De conjugiis prohibitis dissertationes</cite> (Helmstadt, 1705), comprising ten
distinct essays, with a critical and bibliographical supplement, produced
during the years 1699-1705.</p>

<p>The most important collection of church regulations regarding
marriage is Richter's <cite>Die evangelische Kirchordnungen des sechszehnten
Jahrhunderts</cite> (Weimar, 1846). These have been partly analyzed
by Meier, <cite>Jus, quod de forma matrimonii ineundi valet</cite> (Berlin, 1856);
and thoroughly by Goeschen, <cite>Doctrina de matrimonio</cite> (Halle, 1848).
The rejection of priestly celibacy by the Reformers has called forth
numerous writings, among which the earliest are Luther, <cite>Bedenken
und Unterricht von den Klöstern und allen geistlichen Gelübden</cite> (1522);
<cite>idem</cite>, <cite>An die herrn deutschs Ordens</cite> (original edition in the author's
possession, Wittenberg, 1523); Bugenhagen, <cite>De conjugio episcoporum
et diaconorum</cite> (1525); the anonymous <cite>Underricht auss Göttlichen und
Gaystlichen Rechten, Auch auss den flayschlichen Bepstlischen unrechten,
ob ain Priester ain Eeweyb, oder Concubin ... haben möge</cite>
(1526). See also the elaborate treatise of Calixtus, <cite>De conjugio clericorum</cite>
(Frankfort, 1653); and the dissertation of Roldanus, <cite>De mente
Pauli, volentis episcopum esse unius uxoris maritum</cite> (Lugd. Bat., 1710).</p>

<p>On the famous "double marriage" of Landgrave Philip of Hesse a
source of unique interest is the <cite>Argumenta Buceri pro et contra</cite>, a
manuscript by Bucer written in 1539 and first published at Cassel in
1878. The original documents in the case are appended to the exceedingly
lively work of Arcuarius, <cite>Kurtze, Doch unpartheyisch- und Gewissenhaffte
Betrachtung des ... Heiligen Ehestandes</cite> (1679), decidedly
inclining to the side of Luther and his colleagues. Beza, <cite>Tractatio de
polygamia</cite> (Geneva, 1568), replies to the defense of polygamy by Ochino,
<cite>Dialogue</cite> (Zurich, 1563; Eng. trans., London, 1657). The most celebrated
book produced in this controversy is Theophilus Alethaeus's
(Johann Lyser's) <cite>Discursus politicus de polygamia</cite> (2d ed., Freiburg,
1676); or the same with the prefixed general title, <cite>Polygamia triumphatrix</cite>
(Londini Scanorum, 1682), this edition containing the learned and
very elaborate notes of "Athenasius Vincentius" who is none other than
Lyser himself. The first edition, in German, is entitled <cite>Politischer
Discurs zwischen Monogamo und Polygamo</cite> (Freiburg, 1675). Lyser is
harshly answered by Johann Frischen, <cite>Unvorgreiffliche Erörterung der</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
<cite>Frage: Was von der Polygamie oder Viel-Weiberey zu halten sey</cite> (Hamburg,
1677); and more coarsely by "Simplicius Christianus," <cite>Eilfertiges
Antwort-Schreiben.... Darin eine Summarische Widerlegung
des politischen Discurs von der Viel-Weiberey, so ein Atheistischer
Huren-Teuffel J. L. Bosshafftiglich ausgestreuet, enthalten ist</cite> (Leipzig,
1677). In this connection see also Thomasius, <cite>De concubinatu</cite> (Halle,
1713); Baumgart, <cite>De concubinatu, a Christo et apostolis prohibito</cite>
(Halle, 1713); N. N., <cite>De licito concubinatu opponenda</cite> (Freistadt, 1714);
Michaelis, <cite>Paralipomena contra polygamiam</cite> (Göttingen, 1757); Swinderen,
<cite>De polygamia</cite> (Groningae, 1795); Premontval, <cite>La monogamie</cite> (La
Haye, 1751); or the translation by Windheim entitled <cite>Des Herrn Premontvals
Monogamie</cite> (Nuremberg, 1753); Rantzow, <cite>Discussion si la
polygamie est contre la loi nat. ou divine</cite> (St. Petersburg, 1774); and the
works of Madan, Cookson, and others mentioned in the next chapter.
An interesting monograph based on the correspondence of Bucer and
the landgrave is Rady's <cite>Die Reformatoren in ihrer Beziehung zur Doppelehe
des Landgrafen Philipp</cite> (Frankfort and Lucerne, 1890). Luther's
alleged sensuality and coarseness of speech are examined by "Lutherophilus,"
<cite>Das sechste Gebot und Luthers Leben</cite> (Halle, 1893); with
which may be read Altenrath, <cite>Zur Beurtheilung und Würdigung
Martin Luthers</cite> (Frankfort, 1889).</p>

<p>Typical of an extensive literature in the sixteenth century, whose
aim is the appreciation and elevation of marriage, is Adam Colbius von
Buchen's <cite>Christliche Predigten über das Buch Tobie, darinnen, als in
einem lustigen Ehespiegel ... vom heyligen Ehestandt ... erkläret
wirdt</cite> (Frankfort, 1592). On the other hand, in contempt of womanhood
and in mockery of wedlock was produced a mass of prose and
verse coarse and unclean beyond description. Both kinds of writing&mdash;the
evangelical <cite>Ehespiegel</cite> and the literature dedicated to "St. Grobian"&mdash;are
treated in an instructive way by Kawerau, <cite>Die Reformation
und die Ehe</cite> (Halle, 1892). To aid in obtaining a more complete conception
of post-Reformation sentiment may also be consulted Agrippa,
<cite>De nobilitate et praecellentia foeminei sexus libellus</cite> (Coloniae, 1532,
1567); Saxse, <cite>Arcana annuli pronubi, Das ist: Geheimnis und
bedeutung des Ehelichen Traw Ringes</cite> (Leipzig, 1594); Müller, <cite>Ungerathene
Ehe, oder vornehmste Ursachen, so heute den Ehestand zum
Wehestand machen</cite> (Frankfort, 1674); Lehman, <cite>Florilegium politicum
auctum</cite> (Frankfort, 1662); and Feyerabend, <cite>De privilegiis mulierum</cite>
(Jena, 1672). Two learned general treatises, untouched by the Reformation
doctrines, are Johannis Nevizianus's <cite>Sylvae nuptialis libri sex</cite>
(Lugduni, 1556), containing a vast amount of curious matter ostensibly
designed to aid in solving the question, "<em>An nubendum sit, vel non</em>;"
and Antonius Gubertus Costanus's <cite>De sponsalibus, matrimoniis et
dotibus commentarius</cite> (Marpurgi, 1597), dealing in a clear and scholarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
manner with the matrimonial institutions of the Hebrews, Greeks,
Romans, and Christians under the canon law.</p>

<p>Several doctrines of Luther and the early Reformers have each
produced a literature. Whether under various conditions parental
consent is necessary to a legal or valid marriage is discussed by Lohen,
<cite>De parentum ad nuptias a liberis contrahendas consensu</cite> (Regiomonti,
1685); Lauginger, <cite>De consensu parentum ad nuptias liberorum</cite> (Regiomonti,
1699); Schmalian, <cite>De ambitu connubiali: Vom Frey-Werben</cite>
(Wittenberg, 1745); especially by the two great leaders of the "naturalistic"
movement, Thomasius, <cite>De validitate conjugii invitis parentibus
contracti et per benedictionem sacerdotis depositi consummati</cite> (Leipzig,
1689); (Halle and Leipzig, 1722), and J. H. Boehmer, <cite>De matrimonio
coacto</cite> (Halle, 1735). With the last-named dissertation may be read
G. L. Boehmer's <cite>De copulae sacerdotalis a deposito clerico furtim impetratae
injusto favore</cite> (Göttingen, 1745); Delbrück's <cite>De matrimonio ad
benedictionem sacerdotis incompetentis contracto</cite> (Halle, 1759); and in
general on the doctrine of espousals, Greiff, <cite>De pactis futurorum sponsaliorum:
von Ja-Wort</cite> (Halle, 1712); Schelhas, <cite>De clandestinis sponsalibus
juratis: Vulgo von heimlichen Verlöbnüssen</cite> (Jena, 1716);
Bendeleben, <cite>De diverso sponsalium et matrimonii jure</cite> (Halle, 1718);
Sahme, <cite>De matrimonii legitimo absque benedictione sacerdotali</cite> (Halle,
1722); Berger, <cite>De praescriptione sponsaliorum</cite> (Wittenberg, 1724);
Richardus, <cite>De conditionalibus sponsaliorum impossibilibus</cite> (Halle,
1741; presented, 1701); Wachsmuth, <cite>De exceptione sponsaliorum clandestinorum,
ab ipso contrahente opposita</cite> (Jena, 1754). See further, on
special questions, Mentzer, <cite>Num sponsis, ante solennem in ecclesiae copulationem
et benedictionem, concubentibus, publica poenitentia juste
imponatur?</cite> (6th reprint, Wittenberg, 1728); Willenberg, <cite>De matrimonio
imparum</cite> (Halle, 1727); Bennemann, <cite>De natura matrimonii</cite> (Halle,
1708); Krull, <cite>De nuptiis</cite> (Wittenberg, 1632); Schnetter, <cite>De matrimonio
cum damnato ad mortem contrahendo</cite> (Halle, 1727; presented, 1679).</p>

<p>In the modern scientific literature of the subject the first place
belongs to the general treatise of Richter, <cite>Lehrbuch</cite> (8th ed., Leipzig,
1886); the <cite>Lehrbuch</cite> of Friedberg (3d ed., Leipzig, 1889); and Scheurl's
<cite>Das gemeine deutsche Eherecht</cite> (Erlangen, 1882). An older work, very
thorough and very careful in the citation of the literature, is Hofmann's
<cite>Handbuch des teutschen Eherechts</cite> (Jena, 1789); while, besides the
books of Göschl, Lobethan, Schott, and Stäudlin elsewhere described,
Loy's <cite>Das protestantische Eherecht</cite> (Nuremberg and Altdorf, 1793) is of
service. Much valuable biographical and bibliographical material may
be found in the great work of Schulte, <cite>Die Geschichte der Quellen und
Litteratur des canonischen Rechts</cite> (Stuttgart, 1875-80). Important
monographs are Schubert's <cite>Die evangelische Trauung</cite> (Berlin, 1890);
Scheurl's <cite>Die Entwicklung des kirchlichen Eheschliessungsrechts</cite> (Erlangen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
1877); Dieckhoff's <cite>Die kirchliche Trauung</cite> (Rostock, 1878); and
there is an able article by Goeschen, "Ehe," in Herzog's <cite>Encyclopaedie</cite>,
III (Stuttgart and Hamburg, 1855). For the present state of German
matrimonial law consult Blumstengel, <cite>Die Trauung in evangelischem
Deutschland nach Recht und Ritus</cite> (Weimar, 1879); Klein, <cite>Das heutige
Eherecht im Herzogthum Sachsen-Altenburg</cite> (Strassburg, 1881); Stölzel,
<cite>Deutsches Eheschliessungsrecht nach amtlichen Ermittelungen</cite> (3d
ed., Berlin, 1876); and Hergenhahn's work elsewhere mentioned. Several
early church ordinances, and a number of matrimonial decisions of
rare interest from the consistory court of Wittenberg, commencing soon
after its formation, are communicated by Schleusner, "Zu den Anfängen
des protestantischen Eherechts," in <cite>ZKG.</cite>, VI, XII, XIII (Gotha, 1884,
1891, 1892). The "Bedencken" or ordinance adopted at Dresden in 1556
by the three Saxon consistories, with other matter, is also published by
Muther, "Drei Urkunden zur Reformationsgeschichte," in Niedner's
<cite>Zeitschrift für historische Theologie</cite>, XXX (Gotha, 1860). These same
documents and also the famous case of Caspar Beyer (1543-44) are discussed by
Mejer, "Anfänge des Wittenberger Consistoriums," in <cite>ZKR.</cite>,
XIII (Tübingen, 1876). Mejer, "Zur Geschichte des ältesten protestantischen
Eherechts," <i>ibid.</i>, XVI (Freiburg and Tübingen, 1881), gives
an excellent historical, biographical, and bibliographical account of the
Wittenberg consistory; and the two preceding articles, with a discussion
of the establishment of the consistory of Rostock, are reprinted in
his <cite>Zum Kirchenrechte</cite> (Hanover, 1891). Original material is communicated
by Fischer, "Die älteste evangelische Kirchenordnung ...
in Hohenlohe," in <cite>ZKR.</cite>, XV (Freiburg and Tübingen, 1880), and by
Friedberg, <cite>Aus der protestantischen Eherechtspflege des 16. Jahrhunderts</cite>,
reprinted from <cite>ZKR.</cite>, IV (Tübingen, 1864), containing, in connection
with the case of Zaschwitz, letters and other papers of Melanchthon
regarding forbidden degrees. Another article of Friedberg, "Beiträge
zur Geschichte des brandenburgisch-preussischen Eherechts," <i>ibid.</i>, VI,
VII (Tübingen, 1866-67), includes the very long petition of Dr. Stiel
(1553) for enforcement of a betrothal, with other original documents
relating to matrimonial doctrine and judicial practice. A history of
"conditional marriages" is given by Phillips, "Das Ehehinderniss der
beigefügten Bedingung," <i>ibid.</i>, V, VI (Tübingen, 1865-66); and the rise
of the Protestant doctrine regarding the impediment of relationship is
discussed by Scheurl, "Zur Lehre von dem Ehehindernisse der Verwandtschaft,"
<i>ibid.</i>, XVI (Freiburg and Tübingen, 1881). See also the
monograph of Berg, <cite>Ueber die Verbindlichkeit der kanonischen Ehehindernisse
in Betriff der Ehen der Evangelischen</cite> (Breslau, 1835).</p>

<h3>I. AS TO THE FORM OF MARRIAGE</h3>

<p>The Protestant Reformation in Germany produced many
ideas which were eventually fruitful for good in the history
of matrimonial law; but unfortunately, owing to a number
of causes, more than two centuries were to elapse before
any effective remedy was provided for the evils of clandestine
wedlock. Ecclesiastical rites were prescribed by the
authority of the state as the best means of securing publicity;
but neither Luther<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> nor the other Protestant leaders
insisted upon them as necessary to a binding marriage.<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Luther, indeed, perceived the absurdity of the scholastic distinction
between <i>sponsalia de praesenti</i> and <i>de futuro</i>; and
proposed to retain espousals <i>de futuro</i> or precontracts only
in the sense of "conditional betrothals."<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> On failure of the
condition, or for other weighty reasons, these engagements
might be dissolved. But unconditional betrothals, or his
<i>sponsalia de praesenti</i>&mdash;that is to say, practically all betrothals,
including the espousals <i>de futuro</i> of the canonists&mdash;if
publicly made and with parental consent, were regarded by
Luther as valid marriages which could not be dissolved.<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>
Parental consent<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> he appears to think essential, though on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
this point his statements are by no means clear;<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> and he
urges the need of public espousals in face of the parish.<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>
Yet he admits that a secret engagement&mdash;by which he seems
to mean espousals without the presence of witnesses, but
with parental consent&mdash;if followed by physical union, constitutes
a true marriage equally binding with the open
betrothal. In effect, the doctrine of Luther did not provide
a complete remedy for the evils of clandestine contract; for
all marriages, save only the conditional when not consummated,
and possibly those formed secretly against the parents'
will, were now indissoluble at the will of the parties.<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Moreover, an action was allowed to enforce a promise of
marriage; and for more than two centuries after the Reformation
the fulfilment of a betrothal could be enforced by
severe penalties.<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> Yet in one respect there was a decided
advance. The pernicious distinction of Peter Lombard
between espousals <i>de praesenti</i> and <i>de futuro</i> was practically
rejected, and with it much of the danger which had lurked in
the vacillating discretion of the ecclesiastical judge might have
been removed had the jurists accepted Luther's teaching.<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a>
Thus from a historical point of view the result is instructive.
The ancient <i>wette</i> or <i>beweddung</i>, handed down through the
slightly weakened form of the canonical <i>sponsalia de praesenti</i>,
was restored to even more than its original relative
importance as compared with the <i>Trauung</i> or nuptials.<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>The teachings of Luther regarding espousals were largely
determinative for the future history of marriage in the German
states. According to the ordinances, the doctrine, and
the practice of the evangelical churches, the betrothal was a
true marriage, the nuptials merely its confirmation.<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> Even
his wavering as to the necessity of parental consent for a
valid contract leaves its trace in the divergent provisions of
law.<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> In practice the jurists, against the protest of Luther,<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>
held close to the principles of the canon law.<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> As a rule,
the courts tended to treat all secret betrothals followed by
actual connubial life as binding marriages.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> Until far down
into the eighteenth century the engaged lovers before the
nuptials were held to be legally husband and wife.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> It was
common for them to begin living together immediately after
the betrothal ceremony;<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> and the so-called "bride children"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
were given rights of legitimate offspring, this custom in part
surviving until our own times.<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a></p>

<p>The rites observed in the celebration of marriage differed
in some details from those in use before the Reformation.
A model was drafted by Luther, and it was often followed
with variations in the church ordinances.<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> He does not urge
the adoption of a service which must be observed by all. On
the contrary, every place may use its customary form in the
solemnization of wedlock. A simple ritual is, however, provided
for the use of those needing assistance. When the
bride and bridegroom so require, the banns are to be asked
in the chancel before the wedding. As in the mediæval
formularies already examined, the nuptial ceremony consists
of two acts. Before the church door the wedding vows and
the wedding rings are exchanged, the priest declaring to the
assembled people, in the name of the Trinity, that he pronounces
the man and woman joined in marriage. In the
church before the altar the second act takes place. Instead
of the bride-mass, this consists simply in the reading of a
passage of Scripture followed by the priestly benediction.<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>The decree of the Council of Trent relating to the nuptial
celebration was not accepted in Protestant lands, and hence
no essential change was made in the forms of marriage. In
England during the whole period between the Reformation
and the Commonwealth ecclesiastical celebration was the
rule; and the spiritual courts, retaining their ancient jurisdiction
in matrimonial causes, still recognized the principles
of the canon law, though appeals to Rome were not allowed.<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a>
Hence clandestine contracts <i>de praesenti</i> were valid and
could be maintained against regular marriages subsequently
solemnized in church. This fact is established by abundant
evidence,<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> and by none more ample and convincing than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
afforded by the remarkable collection of documents recently
edited by Furnivall, to which further reference will presently
be made.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> But the parties were subject to clerical
censure and the forfeiture of certain property rights.<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> An
attempt was, indeed, made by Henry VIII. in 1540 to restrict
the validity of private marriages by providing in effect that
those solemnized by the church, if consummate, should take
precedence of unconsummated precontracts not thus celebrated;
and the same statute confined the impediments to
marriage to those comprised in the Levitical degrees.<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> But
this act had little significance save in the matrimonial transactions
of Henry himself;<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> for, so far as it related to precontracts,
it was repealed by a statute of Edward VI. which restored
the former law and provided that "when any cause or
contract of marriage is pretended to have been made, it shall
be lawful to the king's ecclesiastical judge of that place to hear
and examine" it; and after having it "sufficiently and lawfully
proved," to give "sentence of matrimony, commanding
solemnization, cohabitation, consummation, and tractation,"
as in times past the king's spiritual courts had power to do.<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a>
Referring to this act, Swinburne, writing in the reign of
Elizabeth, bears witness to the strength with which the
canonical theory of espousals had laid hold of the legal mind.
"Worthily, I say, and upon good ground was this Branch
of that Statute" of King Henry relating to precontracts
"repealed and made void by his gracious Son King <i>Edward</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the Sixth, for Spousals <i>de praesenti</i>, though not consummate,
be in truth and substance very Matrimony, and therefore
perpetually indissoluble, except for Adultery: Although
by the Common Laws of this Realm (like as it is in <i>France</i>
and other places) Spousals not only <i>de futuro</i>, but also <i>de
praesenti</i> be destitute of many <em>legal Effects</em> wherewith
<em>Marriage solemnized</em> doth abound, whether we respect
legitimation of Issue, alteration of property in her Goods,
or right of Dower in the Husbands Lands."<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, for the law and custom of betrothal in England,
toward the close of the sixteenth century, the quaint and
recondite treatise of Swinburne is a mine of information. A
vast number of questions illustrative of the principles, the
snares and perplexities, of the surviving canonical theories
are there taken up and "resolved" with singular brevity and
clearness. "Albeit," he says, "this word <em>Sponsalia</em> (Englished
<em>Spousals</em>) being properly understood, doth only signifie
Promises of future Marriage, yet is it not perpetually
tied to this only Sense, for sometimes it is stretched to the signification
of <em>Love Gifts and Tokens</em> of the Parties betroathed;
as <em>Bracelets</em>, <em>Chains</em>, <em>Jewels</em>, and namely the <em>Ring</em>; being
often used for the very <i>Arrabo</i> or assured Pledge of a perfect
Promise: Sometimes it is taken for the <em>Portion of the
Goods</em> which is given for and in consideration of the Marriage
to be Solemnized; and sometimes for the <em>Feast or
Banquet</em> at the Celebration of the Marriage, and of others
it is otherwise used." The canonists, however, distinguish
between matrimony and betrothal, and they "do also discern
betwixt one kind of Spousals and another, being the first
Inventors of the several Names of Spousals <i>de futuro</i>, and
Spousals <i>de praesenti</i>, and yet nevertheless oftentimes they
make no difference, or very little, betwixt the Natures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Effects of Spousals <i>de praesenti</i> and of Matrimony solemnized
and consummate."<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> Such contracts are "as indissoluble
as perfect matrimony;"<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> and "as well the Sacred
Scriptures, as the Civil and Ecclesiastical Laws, do usually
give to Women betroathed only, or affianced, the Name and
Title of <em>Wife</em>, because in truth the man and woman, thus
perfectly assured, by words of <em>present time</em>, are Husband
and Wife before God and his Church."<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a></p>

<p>The old perplexity growing out of the coincidence of
illegality and validity in the same contract still exists;<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> and
the conscience may still be bound by secret marriage, though
the court may declare it null and void. The "Law doth
forbid all Persons to make <em>Secret</em> Contracts of Spousals, or
Matrimony; and that justly, considering the manifold discommodities
depending thereupon, namely, for that hereby
it cometh to pass oftentimes, that the Parties secretly contracting,
are otherwise formally affianced, or so near in Blood
that they cannot be Married; or being free from those impediments,
yet do they alter their purposes, denying and
breaking their promises, whence Perjuries" and "many
more intolerable mischiefs do succeed."<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> Yet though
"Secret Marriages are done indeed against the Law," it is
held that once contracted they cannot be dissolved, because
public "solemnities are not of the Substance of Spousals, or
of Matrimony, but consent only; ... So that it may be
justly inferred, that the only want of Solemnity doth not
hurt the Contract." Moreover, if it be urged that "seeing
secret Contracts cannot be proved, it is all one in effect, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
if they were not," it may be answered that such is truly the
case "<i>Jure fori, non jure poli</i>, Before Man, not before God;
for the Church indeed doth not judge of secret and hidden
things," but before Almighty God "bare Conscience alone
is as a thousand Witnesses; Wherefore I do admonish thee,
that hast in truth contracted secret Matrimony, that thou do
not marry any other Person; for doubtless this thy pretended
Marriage, how lawful soever it may seem in the eye
of Man, who judgeth only according to the outward appearance,
is nothing but meer Adultery in the infallible sight of
God's just Judgment."<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<p>Public as opposed to private espousals,<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> according to
Swinburne, "are they which are contracted before sufficient
Witnesses, and wherein are observed all other Solemnities
requisite by the Ecclesiastical Law: For so careful were the
ancient Law-makers to avoid those mischiefs, which commonly
attend upon <em>secret</em> and <em>clandestine</em> Contracts, that
they would have the same Solemnities observed in contracting
Spousals, which be requisite in contracting Matrimony."<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>
In fact, according to one authority, "public espousals were,
upon pain of excommunication, to be in an open place, and
before diverse witnesses;" but it does not "appear to have
been necessary to the validity of these contracts, that they
should be made at church;"<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> nor can we safely assume that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
this requirement was generally enforced. During the period
following the Reformation the celebration of the betrothal
and the nuptials usually took place at the same time, on the
wedding day in the body of the church; and the form of
each is prescribed in the marriage rituals.<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> The public
solemnization of espousals was, however, not entirely superseded.
In the seventeenth<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> and eighteenth<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> centuries,
though passing out of use, the custom was by no means
extinct, especially in the case of noble or royal persons. A
record of betrothals contracted <i>in facie ecclesiae</i> was not
usually kept; but at least one such entry has been discovered.
The register of Boughton Monchelsea, Kent, shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
that on the tenth day of January, 1630, William Maddox
and Elizabeth Grimestone were affianced "in due form of
law;" and in this case the marriage was not celebrated until
three years later.<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> "The form of betrothing at church" in
England "has not been handed to us in any of its ancient
ecclesiastical service books;" but it "has been preserved in
a few of the French and Italian rituals."<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> "The ceremony,
generally speaking, was performed by the priest demanding
of the parties if they had entered into a contract with any
other person, or made a vow of chastity or religion; whether
they had acted for each other, or for any child they might
have had, in the capacity of godfather or godmother." Then,
if the contract were in the form of <i>sponsalia jurata</i> or sworn
espousals, the "oath was administered. 'You swear by God
and his holy Saints herein and by all the Saints of Paradise,
that you will take this woman whose name is N., to wife
within forty days, if holy church will permit.' The priest
then joined their hands, and said&mdash;'And thus you affiance
yourselves;' to which the parties answered,&mdash;'Yes, Sir.'
They then received a suitable exhortation on the nature and
design of marriage, and an injunction to live piously and
chastily until that event should take place. They were not
permitted, at least by the church, to reside in the same
house, but were nevertheless regarded as man and wife
independently of the usual privileges."<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> Later in France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
espousals in church were often prohibited, "because instances
frequently occurred when the parties, relying on the testimony
of the priest, scrupled not to live together as man and
wife.... Excesses were likewise often committed by the
celebration of Espousals in taverns and ale-houses, and some
of the synodal decrees expressly injoin that the parties shall
not get drunk on these occasions."<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a></p>

<p>Valid betrothals, like valid marriages, may be celebrated
by signs as well as words. This is true, says Swinburne,
notwithstanding "a ready text, extant in the bowels of the
law," much relied upon by diverse writers, to the effect that
words expressive of consent are essential.<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> "And forasmuch
as <i>Subarration</i>, that is the giving and receiving of a <i>Ring</i>,
is a Sign of all others, most usual in Spousals and Matrimonial
Contracts, I think it requisite to speak of it, before
all other Signs; the rather because the Writers upon this
Sign have diligently described unto us, what Persons did
first devise the same, and to what end; and what was the
matter, and what the form thereof, on which Finger it ought
to be worn, and what is the Signification of each of those
Circumstances, with divers other Observations which I
will briefly run over. The first Inventer of the Ring (as
is reported) was one <i>Prometheus</i>; The Workman which
made it was <em>Tubal-Cain</em>, of whom there is mention in the
fourth of Genesis, that he wrought cunningly in every Craft
of Brass and Iron: And Tubal-Cain by the Counsel of our
first Parent <em>Adam</em> (as my Author telleth me), gave it unto
his Son to this end, that therewith he should espouse a
Wife, like as <em>Abraham</em> delivered unto his Servant Bracelets
and Ear-Rings of Gold, which he gave to <em>Rebecca</em>, when he
chose her to be <em>Isaacks</em> Wife.... But the first Ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
was not of Gold, but of Iron, adorned with an Adamant,
the Metal hard and durable, signifying the continuance and
perpetuity of the Contract; the vertuous Adamant drawing
the Iron unto it, signifying the perfect unity and indissoluble
Conjunction of their minds, in true and faithful
love; Howbeit it skilleth not at this day, what Metal the
Ring be; The form of the Ring being circular, that is,
round, and without end, importeth thus much, that their
mutual love and hearty affection should roundly flow from
the one to the other, as in a Circle, and that continually,
and for ever; The Finger on which this Ring is to be worn
is the fourth Finger of the left hand, next unto the little
Finger; because by the received Opinion of the Learned and
Experienced in Ripping up, and anatomizing Mens Bodies,
there is a Vein of Blood which passeth from that fourth
Finger unto the Heart, called <i>Vena amoris</i>, Love's Vein.
And so the wearing of the Ring on that Finger signifieth,
that the love should not be vain or fained, but that as they
did give their Hands each to other, so likewise they should
give their Hearts also, whereunto that Vein is extended.
Furthermore I do observe, that in former Ages it was not
tolerated to single or unmarried Persons to wear Rings,
unless they were Judges, Doctors, or Senators, or such like
honourable Persons: So that being destitute of such Dignity,
it was a note of Vanity, Lasciviousness, and Pride for them
to presume to wear a Ring, whereby we may collect how
greatly they did honour and reverence the Sacred Estate of
Wedlock in times past, in permitting the Parties affianced
to be adorned with the honourable Ornament of the Ring:
As also the Vanity, Lasciviousness, and intolerable Pride of
these our days, wherein every skipping Jack and every
flirting Jill, must not only be ring'd (forsooth) very daintily,
but must have some special Jewel or Favour besides, as
though they were descended of some noble House or Parentage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
when as all their Houses and whole Patrimony is
not worth the Ninth part of a Noble; or else, as if they
were betrothed or assured in the holy Band of Wedlock,
when as indeed, there is no manner of Contract betwixt
them, unless peradventure it be such a Contract as <em>Judah</em>
made with <em>Thamar</em>, ... which bargain he concluded by
delivering her a Ring."<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a></p>

<p>This curious passage is here quoted at length, not because
it has historical value, but because the author has condensed
therein the symbolism, conceits, and folklore connected with
the betrothal ring as these are found in the writings of the
canonists, whom he carefully and minutely cites in the
margin.<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a></p>

<p>Before the act of 1753 persons contracting espousals <i>de
praesenti</i> might be compelled to celebrate matrimony <i>in
facie ecclesiae</i>, under penalty for refusal of excommunication
by the spiritual and imprisonment by the secular power;<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>
but in case of a mere contract <i>de futuro</i>, if either party
refused to keep his engagement, he was rather to be "admonished
than compelled." The "judge is not to proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
to the <i>Significavit</i>, but rather to absolve that cursed Party
which contemneth the Censures of the Church, albeit there
be no Cause of favour, but fear of further mischief, by compelling
them to go together, which hate one another. Yet
is not this froward Party thus to be dismissed, but is to
suffer pennance" for breach of faith.<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a></p>


<h3>II. AS TO THE NATURE OF MARRIAGE</h3>

<p>In its practical results, therefore, the Reformation had
little effect on law and theory as to the <em>form</em> of wedlock.
For England it had no significance at all; and the same is
true of Germany, except so far as Luther's view of the
<em>sponsalia</em> may have found some expression in legislation
and judicial decree. With respect to the <em>nature</em> of marriage
the case is very different. The dogma of its sacramental
character was abandoned throughout the Protestant world.<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>
In its place a new conception arose; and it is very instructive
to trace the process of change in the mind of Luther
himself.<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> As late as 1519 he declares that "the marriage
state is a sacrament," an outward "symbol of the greatest,
holiest, noblest, most worthy thing that has ever existed or
can exist: the union of the divine and human natures in
Christ;"<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> and this symbol he explains entirely in harmony
with the "dogmatism of the Middle Ages, notably that of
St. Thomas Aquinas, who sought the motive of marriage
sacrament in legalization of the sensual impulse."<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> In the
very next year, however, and again in 1539, he expresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
himself decisively against the ancient Catholic doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a>
Nevertheless in his various attempts to define the matrimonial
state an apparent contradiction is presented which is
hard to reconcile, and which is of great significance in the
long struggle for the instituting of civil marriage. On the
one hand, though not technically a sacrament, marriage is
described as holy, a "most spiritual" status, "ordained and
founded" by God himself. It is the source of domestic and
public government, the foundation of human society, which
without it would "fall to pieces."<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> So holy is the state of
matrimony, in Luther's conception, that he must perforce
still use the term "sacrament" to convey his meaning.<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> On
the other hand, his writings contain passages of a very
different tenor. "So many lands, so many customs, runs
the common saying. Therefore since weddings and matrimony
are a temporal business, it becomes us clerks and
servants of the church to order or rule nothing therein, but
to leave to each city and state its own usages and customs in
this regard."<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> Elsewhere, in words which anticipate the
sentiment of Milton by a hundred years, he insists that
"matrimonial questions do not touch the conscience, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
belong to the temporal power," warning the clergy not to
meddle with them unless commanded by that authority.<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a>
Marriage, he emphatically declares, is a "temporal, worldly
thing" which "does not concern the church."<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a></p>

<p>Thus Luther provided the arsenal from which both the
friends and the foes of civil marriage drew their weapons.
His name, says Friedberg, became the "battle-cry," the
"shield and mantle," of the contending factions; and while
urging that Luther must be regarded as the champion of
marriage as a "worldly thing," the same writer points out
the two powerful motives which may in large measure
account for this apparent contradiction.<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> First, the evils
growing out of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction in matrimonial
causes were becoming an intolerable burden to Christendom;
and only by denying the sacramental nature of marriage
could the way be cleared for a transfer of that jurisdiction
to the secular courts. Secondly, the abuses connected with
sacerdotal celibacy were scarcely less threatening. The
licentiousness of the clergy was "beyond belief." Many
"bishops were at last content to convert the vows of celibacy
into sources of revenue, suffering the clergy to live in concubinage
in return for a yearly tax;"<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> and yet the "ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
preserved chastity of the priesthood was interpenetrated
then as before by a profound contempt for the marriage
state."<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> Hence Luther proclaimed the natural and scriptural
right of priests to marry; and rejecting the low ascetic
ideal he laid stress on the purity and holiness of marriage
as an institution ordained of heaven.<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> But, after all, this
doctrine is not so entirely out of harmony with the view that
matrimony is a "worldly thing;" for with the Reformation
a new conception of the temporal power arose. During the
Middle Ages the contrast was not between church and state,
as the latter is now understood; but between the "unholy
world and the holy church." Hence the state, because it
was comprehended under the conception of the world, "partook
of its unholiness. The Reformation formulated the
antithesis differently. It released the state from its shell
of 'worldliness,' ascribed to it ethical tendencies, and made
it the bearer of morality. Formerly the state was unholy,
because it belonged to the world; now the world became
ethical, because it fell within the sphere of the state, for the
state itself was moral."<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> Thus, in the sixteenth century, the
conception of the "Christian state" and of the "Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
prince," to which Erasmus gave such fine expression, became
thoroughly established.<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> Theoretically church and state
were kept apart; but practically they were united; for the
idea of a "state church" no longer gave a shock to the
religious sense. Accordingly the king as the Lord's
anointed became the defender of the faith and the source
of ecclesiastical authority.</p>

<p>With Luther's teachings regarding the nature of marriage
the German Protestant leaders were mainly agreed.<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> In his
reaction against celibacy and asceticism, however, he went
to an extreme where all could not follow him. There were
doubtless many persons attached to the new doctrines who
were inclined to tolerate or sanction concubinage and even
polygamy.<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> But the "double marriage" of the landgrave
of Hesse, which was sanctioned by Luther, Melanchthon,
and Bucer, created a scandal for which the majority were
not willing to be held responsible. Indeed, from the tone
of the decision of Luther and his colleagues it seems clear
that they were conscious of treading on dangerous ground.<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a>
Regarding another important point the Reformers were not
entirely in harmony. The abuses arising in the complex
law relating to forbidden degrees and the other canonical
impediments, it was felt, ought to be remedied. But there
was much divergence of opinion as to the "exact content of
the reform needed and even as to the principle which ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
to be followed. Should simply a return be made to the
Mosaic or to the Roman law?" Or should the canon law be
retained with certain modifications?<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> All were agreed that
the hindrance of spiritual kinship must be absolutely
abandoned; and there was a tendency to allow intermarriage
within the third degree of affinity and consanguinity.<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a>
But there was much diversity in legislation and judicial
practice, the rules of the Levitical code being followed with
varied interpretations.<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> By the old Protestant law and
doctrine, as well as by the rule of the mother church,
<i>disparitas cultus</i>, or difference of religious faith, was
regarded as an impediment to wedlock. Marriages between
Christians and non-Christians were positively forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a>
In like spirit, unions between adherents of different Christian
confessions were either entirely prohibited or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
severely discouraged.<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> Such intolerance was sure to produce
the natural bitter fruit; and the controversy over these
"mixed marriages" has perpetuated itself to our own times.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<p>In England as well as in Germany the law and judicature
of the church rested on the sanction of the state.<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> This is
the fundamental fact in the history of the English revolt
from Rome. But, owing to the peculiar circumstances of
that revolt, the investiture of the king with the headship of
the church was very unfortunate. Henry VIII. clung to
the old doctrines. A stumbling-block was thus placed in
the way of intellectual and spiritual progress which in the
end cost a second revolution to remove. The effects of this
unlucky settlement are plainly discernible in the ecclesiastical
conception of marriage. If the teachings of the fathers
of the English church<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> be examined for the period between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
the death of Wolsey and the death of Elizabeth, it will be
found that they are less bold, showing more of the spirit of
compromise with the mediæval doctrines, than are those of
Luther and his immediate followers on the continent. Not
a single clear voice, apparently, is raised for civil marriage.
Technically matrimony as a sacrament is rejected by all,<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a>
though its sacramental nature was first definitely denied by
the church in the Thirty-nine Articles of 1552.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> It is, however,
something more than a mere civil status. It is, declares
Fulke, "nothing else but a devilish slander to say that we
'esteem it but in respect of the flesh, or for a civil contract.'"<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a>
Tyndale calls matrimony "a similitude of the kingdom of
heaven;"<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> and in general it is held to be a holy institution,
"ordained by God himself in Paradise."<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> It represents the
union of Christ and the church;<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> and it is "pure," "dignified,"
and "honorable" for all men.<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> Hence the natural and
scriptural right of priests to marry is vindicated;<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> and, following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
St. Paul, the forbidding of them to marry is called
a "doctrine of devils."<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a></p>

<p>Still the new teaching did not at once find expression in
the law of the land. Under its influence, at the beginning
of the Reformation, some of the clergy, notably Archbishop
Cranmer, married; but Henry VIII. tenaciously clung to
the doctrine of clerical celibacy and issued several proclamations
against the marriage of priests.<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> Thus in 1535 "his
majestie understanding that a few number of this his realme
being priests, as well religious as other, have taken wives,
and married themselves," and not wishing the "generalitie
of the clergy" to follow their example, doth command all
such priests "as have attempted marriages" or shall "hereafter
presumptuously proceed in the same, that they nor any
of them shall minister any sacrament or other ministry
mysticall, nor have any office, dignity, cure, privilege, profitt
or commoditye heretofore accustomed, and belonging to the
clergie of this realme, but shall utterly after such marriages
be expelled and deprived from the same, and be had and
reputed as lay persons, to all purposes and intents. And
that such as shall after this proclamation ... take wives,
and be married, shall run in his grace's indignation, and
suffer further punishment and imprisonment at his grace's
will and pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> Proclamations<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> of like nature were
later enacted; and finally the six-articles law of 1539 provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
that all marriages or matrimonial contracts, made by
priests or between a man and a woman either of whom has
vowed chastity, before or during "this present parliament,"
shall "be utterly void and of none effect;" while any future
transgression is to be punished as felony.<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> Nevertheless
Cranmer was allowed to retain his wife; and through his
influence the penalties prescribed by the six-articles act
were somewhat modified in 1540.<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></p>

<p>Under Edward VI. the doctrine of the Reformation
gained a victory. The six-articles law was repealed in
1547.<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> In the same year the lower house of convocation
prayed "that all provisions against clerical marriages might
be set aside and all vows of chastity pronounced void."<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a>
Accordingly by 2 and 3 Edward VI. (1548), c. 21, the obstacles
to such unions were formally swept away on grounds
of expediency; though the act sanctions the ancient prejudice
by declaring that "it were not only better for the estimation
of priests, and other ministers in the Church of God,
to live chaste, sole, and separate from the company of women
and the bond of marriage, but also thereby they might the
better intend to the administration of the gospel, and be less
intricated and troubled with the charge of household, being
free and unburdened from the care and cost of finding wife and
children, and that it were most to be wished that they would
willingly endeavour themselves to a perpetual chastity."<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
This clause was explained by the act of 5 and 6 Edward VI.
(1551-52), c. 12, "as meaning not simply that the marriages
in question were exempt from punishment, but that they
were good and lawful marriages, the offspring of which
were legitimate and could inherit in the usual way, and that
priests might be tenants by courtesy on the death of their
wives, and wives endowable of their lands."<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a></p>

<p>After the accession of Mary, a royal ordinance again prescribed
celibacy as the condition of holding priestly office.<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a>
The matrimonial laws of Edward's reign were repealed;<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> and
it is significant of Elizabeth's conservative position on religious
questions that those enactments were not restored on
her coming to power. She was shocked at the marriage of
priests and was very reluctant to sanction it by statute.
"The Queen's majesty," writes Sandys to Parker in 1559,
"will wink at it but not stablish it by law, which is nothing
else but to bastard our children;"<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> and two years later,
according to Cecil, "her majesty continueth very evil affected
to the state of matrimony in the clergy. And if [I] were
not therein very stiff," she "would utterly and openly condemn
and forbid it."<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> Yet already by her first Injunctions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
1559, she had grudgingly given her consent to clerical marriage,
though it was hampered by severe conditions. "It is
thought therefore very necessary, that no manner of priest
or deacon shall hereafter take to his wife any manner of
woman without the advice and allowance first had upon good
examination by the bishop of the same diocese, and two justices
of the peace of the same shire, dwelling next to the
place, where the same woman hath made her most abode
before her marriage; nor without the good will of the parents
of the said woman, if she have any living, or two of the next
of her kinsfolk, or, for lack of knowledge of such, of her
master or mistress, where she serveth." If "any shall do
otherwise," he is forbidden to administer either the "word"
or the "sacraments," and is declared incapable of "any
ecclesiastical benefice." The marriage of a bishop is allowed
only on approval of the "metropolitan of the province" and
of "such commissioners" as the queen may appoint; while
the master, dean, or head of a college must obtain the consent
of those to whom the right of visitation belongs, who
shall provide that the marriage "tend not to the hindrance
of their house."<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> Two years later "the queen further ordained
that, upon pain of forfeiting his office, no head or
member of any college or cathedral church should have his
wife or other woman within the precincts,"<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> and "in the
thirty-nine articles of 1563 the marriage of the clergy was
recognized as permissible."<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> Still throughout the reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Elizabeth, apparently, clerical marriages continued to be
resisted; for "in the <em>Millenary Petition</em> addressed by the
Puritans to James I. at his accession, among other requests
was one for the restoration of the laws of Edward VI. as to
the marriage of priests.<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> That restoration and, consequently,
the repeal of the obstructing act of Mary were accomplished"
in 1603.<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a></p>

<p>In fact, the primitive ascetic ideal was by no means
utterly extinct among the Protestant theologians of the
Tudor period. Some, like Latimer, Fulke, and Hutchinson,
insist that matrimony is inferior to virginity;<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> and very
generally it is still held to be ordained of heaven, especially
as a "remedy" for sin, though more worthy motives are
admitted. According to Bradford, God "has made womankind,
and ordained the state of matrimony," "not only for
the help and community of man, but also for a remedy of
man's infirmity."<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> Bullinger assigns the usual three reasons
"for which God hath ordained marriage for men to
embrace." The "first cause why wedlock was instituted
is man's commodity, that thereby the life of man might
be the pleasanter and more commodious; for Adam seemed
not to live half happily nor sweetly enough, unless he had
a wife to join himself unto; which wife is not in the scriptures
called an impediment or necessary evil, as certain
poets and beastly men who hated women have foolishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
jangled."<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> The "second cause is the begetting of children
for the preservation of mankind;" and the third is to provide
a safeguard against the weakness of the flesh.<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a></p>

<p>Thus the change effected by the religious revolution in
the conception of marriage, highly important as it was from
a speculative point of view, was not destined to bear its
proper fruit until after many days. In Germany, after a
time, the bolder and more liberal teachings of Luther were
generally ignored; so that by the middle of the seventeenth
century the reactionary theories which had then gained
ascendency were substantially in harmony with the ideas of
the English clergy. In both countries the ecclesiastical
courts still continued to try matrimonial causes in the
spirit of the canon law; and more and more, as the new
churches grew in power and became conservative, did the
theological view of the nature of marriage approach the
ancient dogma. "According to the canon law, the church
claimed matrimonial jurisdiction because marriage was a
sacrament; by the Protestants marriage was made almost a
sacrament because the church exercised matrimonial jurisdiction."<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a>
Not until the full triumph of civil marriage in
the nineteenth century were the logical results of the new
doctrines at last attained.</p>


<h3>III. CHILD-MARRIAGES IN THE AGE OF ELIZABETH</h3>

<p>Seldom has a more vivid light been thrown on social conditions
than that afforded for the age of Elizabeth by the
depositions taken in the bishop's court of the diocese of
Chester, 1561-66, and edited for the Early English Text<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Society by Furnivall in 1897. Their value for the student
is enhanced by the very lively "forewords" of the
learned and enthusiastic editor. The evils naturally flowing
from the law and doctrine of espousals are here realistically
disclosed in the "trothplights" and the similar cases of
"clandestine marriages."<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> There is the usual juggling with
the words of the present or future tense; and the usual
puzzling over conditions and irregular phrases. For the
basest of motives girls are tricked into vows which may or
may not prove to be valid marriages according to the uncertain
interpretation of the words or acts of betrothal
sworn to in court. "Ten of the seventeen cases" of trothplight,
says Furnivall, "show us men trying to sneak
out of their contracts when they've had their fill of pleasure
with the women."<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> Needy and unscrupulous priests,
worthy predecessors of the notorious Fleet parsons, without
banns or license, are seen "solemnizing" the nuptials "accordinge
to the book of Common prayer," in a private house,
in a meadow, or on the "heighe waie," during "the night
season" and "by the lighte of the moone."<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a></p>

<p>The astonishing prevalence of child-marriages is, however,
the most important fact revealed by these documents.<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> In a
single diocese during the short space of six years, besides
three "ratifications," occurred twenty-eight cases of so-called
divorce or voidance of contracts which were formed in infancy
or early childhood. The age of the persons varies from two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
to thirteen years; and in at least ten cases the girl is older
than the boy. It should also be observed that these thirty-one
contracts are merely those brought before the court for
confirmation or annulment after at least one of the parties
has reached the age of puberty, which by the canon law is
fixed at twelve for females and fourteen for males. It is, of
course, proper to assume that the number of child-marriages
which never thus came up for settlement was very much
larger than the number of those which did so arise. What
the number for all England may have been during the period,
it is startling to contemplate! Moreover, the majority of
these marriages took place, not among the rich or noble, but
among common people of small means. In a number of
instances we are told in the record that the infant bride or
bridegroom was carried before the priest in someone's arms.
Thus, in a case which arose in 1564, a witness deposes that
"he was present bie, when John Somerforth and Jane Brerton
were maried together in the parish church of Brerton
about xij yeres ago ... that he carried the said John in
his armes, beinge at tyme of the said Mariage about iij yeres
of age, and spake somme of the wordes of Matrimonye, that
the said John, bie reason of his younge age, cold not speake
hym self, holdinge him in his armes all the while the wordes
of Matrimonie were in speakinge. And one James Holford
caried the said Jane in his armes, beinge at the said tyme
about ij yeres of age, and spake all, or the most parte of, the
wordes of matrimony for her." Being further "required
whether the said marriage was euer ratified bie carnall Copulacion
or other meane, Answereth that, in his Conscience, it
was neuer." Another witness testified to the same facts and
added, "it was the youngest Mariage that euer he was at."<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a></p>

<p>Looked at from a religious point of view, it would be
hard to imagine a more absurd travesty of "holy wedlock"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
than such proceedings conducted by the parish priest.<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> Nor
was there much sentiment involved in the matter. If the
great folk betrothed their children while babes to escape the
king's right of wardship, the small folk were influenced by
like motives on a smaller scale. "If the parent of either
child is mercenary," summarizes Furnivall, "a money-bargain
is made for it: the father of a boy of two, gets from
an older girl's father, 'monie to bie a pece of land,' and executes
a Bond to repay the money if his boy doesn't marry
the girl (pp. 6-9). In another case, the boy's father is in
debt, 'and to get somme money of William Whitfield, to the
discharge of his debtes, maried and bargained his sonne to
the said Whitfeildes doughter' (pp. 23, 24). Again, a girl of
3 or 4 is married to a boy of 7 'biecause her frendes thought
she shuld have had a lyvinge bie hym' (p. 4), and her father-in-law
is under Bond to marry them (p. 5). So again, a
girl's father says that she married a boy of her own age,
11-12 'biecause she shold have had bie hym a prety bargane,
yf they cold have lovid, on the other' (p. 12). Another
girl of 11 is married to a boy of 9, because, on her father's
death, the boy's father gets the landlord's leave to take-on
the girl's house (p. 10). Another girl of 8 is married to a
boy of 10, because the boy's father feard 'lest he shuld lose
his parte of his lyvinge' in a tenement which he held in
common with the girl's protector (p. 14). In another instance,
the girl's grandfather 'was a very welthie man; and it was
supposed that he wold have bene good vnto' her &amp; her boy-husband,
'and bestowid somme good ferme apon her' (p. 32),
so a boy of 12 married her when she was 10. Other children
are married 'bie the compulsion of their frendes' (pp. 11, 13,
23 &amp;c.); another 'by a wile' (p. 16), the girl being invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
by a relation of the boy's to come and make merry, and then
married to the boy against her consent. But in one case, a
girl arranged her own marriage. She was 'a bigge damsell
&amp; mariageable' (p. 47), that is, past 12, and evidently fancying
a nice boy of 10-11, 'intised hym with two Apples, to
go with her to Colne, and to marry her' (p. 45). No wonder
that this boy 'repentid' next morning, and that others say
'at the tyme of their mariage they knewe not what they did'
(p. 15)."<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

RISE OF CIVIL MARRIAGE</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note X.</span>&mdash;The beginning of the Puritan conception
of marriage as a civil contract is best seen in Whitgift's "Defence
of the Answer," <cite>Works</cite> (Parker Society, Cambridge, 1851-53), comprising
Cartwright's <cite>Reply to the Answer</cite>, as well as extracts from the <cite>Answer</cite>
itself, and from the original <cite>Admonition</cite> of 1572 which gave rise to the
whole controversy. The views of the Independents, when fully developed,
find their fullest expression in the writings of Milton on marriage
and divorce, constituting, besides scattered allusions, Vol. III of his
<cite>Prose Works</cite> (Bohn ed., London, 1888); the <cite>Likeliest Means to remove
Hirelings out of the Church</cite>, and the version of Bucer's <cite>De regno
Christi</cite>, entitled <cite>The Judgment of Martin Bucer</cite>, being of special
interest in this connection. For the early period some useful material
is afforded by Prothero's <cite>Statutes and Constitutional Documents</cite> (Oxford,
1894); Brereton's <cite>Travels in Holland</cite>, 1634-35: "Chetham Society
Publications," Vol. I; Hallam's <cite>Constitutional History</cite> (New York,
1880); and Ranke's <cite>England in the Seventeenth Century</cite> (Oxford, 1875).</p>

<p>The act of 1653 is contained in Scobell's <cite>Collection of Acts and
Ordinances, 1640-1656</cite> (London, 1658); and in the contemporary newspaper
entitled <cite>Several Proceedings of Parliament</cite>, No. 6; but, like all
the acts of the revolutionary period, it is omitted in every edition of
the <cite>Statutes at Large</cite>. Original material for a study of the administration
of this law may be found in the parish registers covering the interregnum
edited by Bulwer, <cite>Parish Registers of St. Martin-cum-Gregory
in the City of York</cite>, Part IV (York, 1895); Cowper, <cite>The Booke of Register
of the Parish of St. Peter in Canterbury</cite> (Canterbury, 1888); <cite>Parish
Registers of Ellough, Suffolk</cite> (privately printed, 1886); Hoveden, <cite>The
Register Booke ... of the Cathedral and Metropoliticall Church

<cite>The Non-Conformist Register</cite> (Brighouse, 1881). There is an interesting
table in Graunt's <cite>Natural and Political Observations</cite> (Oxford,
1665); and examples of marriage certificates and other records under
the act of 1653 may be found in <cite>The Register Booke of Inglebye iuxta
Grenhow</cite> (Canterbury, 1889); Burn's <cite>Parish Registers</cite>; Friedberg's
<cite>Eheschliessung</cite>; <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> (London, 1850 ff.); and the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite> (London, 1731 ff.). The two periodicals just mentioned,
like the <cite>Monthly Review</cite> (London, 1749 ff.), contain a great deal of
matter&mdash;curious antiquities as well as serious discussion&mdash;relative to
Fleet marriages, the Hardwicke act, and other phases of the subject.
Inderwick's <cite>Interregnum</cite> (London, 1891) has an instructive discussion
of some questions connected with the marriage act; and like Jenk's
<cite>Constitutional Experiments</cite> (Cambridge, 1890) it is valuable for appreciating
the legislation of the Commonwealth. Lathbury's <cite>History of
the Book of Common Prayer</cite> (Oxford and London, 1859) describes the
operation of the act; and some cases noted in Jeaffreson's <cite>Middlesex
County Records</cite> (London, n. d.) prove the need of the safeguard against
abduction or fraud afforded by the act; and there are a number of
useful documents in the <cite>Reports of the Historical Manuscripts Commission</cite>.
Illustrations of the ridicule called out by banns in the
market-place and the justices' celebration may be found in Butler's
<cite>Hudibras</cite> (Boston, 1864), and Flecknoe's <cite>Diarium</cite> (London, 1656).</p>

<p>On the Fleet and Mayfair celebrations Burn's now very scarce <cite>Fleet
Marriages</cite> (2d ed., London, 1834) is the chief authority. It is supplemented
by his <cite>Parish Registers</cite>; and these books as well as the original
sources have been used for Friedberg's excellent account in the <cite>Eheschliessung</cite>,
which on this topic and the whole ground covered by the
present chapter is a trustworthy guide. A famous contemporary book
is Brady's <cite>Some Considerations upon Clandestine Marriages</cite> (2d ed.,
London, 1750). There is an article by Ewald, "Fleet Marriages," in his
<cite>Paper and Parchment</cite> (London, 1890); and Waters's excellent <cite>Parish
Registers</cite> (new ed., London, 1883) is more reliable than the similar
work of Burn. Fleet marriages are also discussed, with interesting
extracts from the contemporary newspapers, by Tegg, <cite>The Knot Tied</cite>
(London, 1877); Ashton, <cite>The Fleet</cite> (London, 1889); and Jeaffreson,
<cite>Brides and Bridals</cite> (London, 1872), whose book, like Brand's <cite>Observations
on the Popular Antiquities of Great Britain</cite> (London, 1873-77),
contains a mass of information relating to every phase of marriage customs.
On these marriages and on the Hardwicke act see also Horace
Walpole's <cite>Letters</cite> (London, 1880); and Lecky, <cite>History of England in
the 18th Century</cite> (New York, 1879).</p>

<p>Many illustrations of matrimonial usage and folklore may be found
in Howlett, "Marriage Customs," in Andrews's <cite>Curious Church Customs</cite>

Queen Anne</cite> (London, 1882); and Hutchinson, <cite>Chronicles of Gretna
Green</cite> (London, 1844). In England as well as in Germany the question
of polygamy was much debated. A version of Ochino was brought
out by Garfeild, <cite>A Dialogue of Polygamy</cite> (London, 1657). This was
followed by the anonymous <cite>Concubinage and Polygamy Disproved</cite>
(London, 1698); Turner, <cite>Discourse on Fornication with an Appendix
on Concubinage</cite> (London, 1698); Delany, <cite>Reflections upon Polygamy</cite>
(London, 1737), opposing the practice; Hamilton, <cite>A Treatise on Polygamy
proving it to be the Will of God</cite> (Dublin, 1786); especially the
notorious work of Madan, <cite>Thelyphthora; or a Treatise on Female
Ruin</cite> (2d ed., London, 1781); answered by Towers, <cite>Polygamy Unscriptural;

<h3>I. CROMWELL'S CIVIL MARRIAGE ACT, 1653</h3>

<p>It was not until the middle of the seventeenth century
that the ideas of the early German<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> Reformation relating to
the temporal nature of marriage gained ascendancy in England,
and then only for the brief period of the Commonwealth.
Yet the civil-marriage act of 1653 is of extraordinary
historical interest, not only as an example of the statesmanship
of Cromwell, so often anticipating the reforms of our own
age, but especially as being mainly the result of the revolt of
the Puritans, more particularly of the Independents, against
the unnatural union of church and state produced by the compromise
of the sixteenth century, and of their intense hatred
of the formalism and ceremonial of the "Romanizing" party
in the established church. The act is of special significance
for our present purpose, since it reveals the conceptions
which shaped the matrimonial laws of New England. Paradoxical
as it may at first glance appear, it cannot be doubted
that the first establishment of obligatory civil marriage in
England owes its origin chiefly to the desire of an intensely
religious party to separate all things worldly from the functions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
of the clergy and the church.<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> True, a foreign people,
closely related by blood and speech, with whom England
had long had intimate relations and to whom the Puritans
were drawn through sympathy with their heroic resistance
to ecclesiastical oppression, had already provided a model,
which may have had a certain influence. For in the Netherlands,
on April 1, 1580, after the independence from Spain
had been declared, the provinces of Holland and West Friesland
had established a civil-marriage form, permissively even
for the members of the Reformed church; and in principle
this was adopted by the States General for the United Provinces
in 1656, three years after the appearance of the English
statute under consideration.<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a></p>

<p>Familiar as many Englishmen probably were with Dutch
institutions,<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> and close as had been the relations of Dutch and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
English Puritans,<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> so important an event as the introduction
of civil marriage can hardly be due primarily to imitation.
Though Holland may have provided a model, it must be
essentially the product of English religious history. Already
in the reign of Elizabeth there are signs of discontent with the
established ritual and with the quasi-sacramental character
of marriage as conceived by the Anglican clergy. Especially
obnoxious to the Protestant non-conformists, as appears from
the well-known controversy between Whitgift and Thomas
Cartwright, leader of the English Presbyterian party, are
the use of the ring, the "worshipping" of the bride by the
bridegroom, requiring the newly married pair to partake
of the communion, and certain customs popularly connected
with the wedding celebration, but not enjoined by the liturgy.
"As for matrimony," runs a passage in the celebrated <cite>Admonition
to the Parliament</cite>, published in 1572, "that also hath
corruptions, too many. It was wont to be counted a sacrament;
and therefore they use yet a sacramental sign, to
which they attribute the virtue of wedlock, I mean the
wedding-ring, which they foully abuse and dally withal, in
taking it up and laying it down: in putting it on they abuse
the name of the Trinity, they make the new-married man,
according to the popish form, to make an idol of his wife,
saying 'with this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship,'
etc. And because in popery no holy action may be
done without a mass, they enjoin the married persons to
receive the communion (as they do their bishops and priests
when they are made), etc. Other petty things out of the
book we speak not of, as that women, contrary to the rule of
the apostle, come, and are suffered to come, bareheaded, with
bagpipes and fiddlers before them, to disturb the congregation,
and that they must come in at the great door of the
church, else all is marred [with divers other heathenish toys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
in sundry countries, as carrying of wheat-sheaves on their
heads, and casting of corn, with a number of such like,
whereby they make rather a May-game of marriage than a
holy institution of God]."<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a></p>

<p>In his <cite>Answer to the Admonition</cite> Whitgift denies that the
ring is looked upon as a "sacramental sign," and admits that
"it is not material" whether it "be used or not;" while he
quotes with approval Bucer's opinion<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> that the "ceremony is
very profitable, if the people be made to understand what is
thereby signified, as that the ring and other things, first laid
upon the book, and afterward by the minister given to the
bridegroom to be delivered to the bride, do signify that we
ought to offer all that we have to God before we use them,
and to acknowledge that we receive them at his hand to be
used to his glory. The putting of the ring upon the fourth
finger of the woman's left hand, to which, as it is said there
cometh a sinew or string from the heart, doth signify that
the heart of the wife ought to be united to her husband; and
the roundness of the ring doth signify that the wife ought
to be joined to her husband with a perpetual band of love,
as the ring itself is without end." Cartwright in his <cite>Reply</cite>
declares that "if it be M. Bucer's judgment which is alleged
here for the ring, I see that sometimes Homer sleepeth. For,
first of all, I have shewed that it is not lawful to institute
new signs and sacraments. And, then, it is dangerous to do
it, especially in this which confirmeth the false and popish
opinion of a sacrament." Next he ridicules Bucer for his
"fond allegories" touching the ring, and thinks that having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
"the minister to preach upon these toys" savoureth not of
his learning and sharpness of judgment.<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> Whitgift, however,
further defends the practice on the score of "convenience"
and because it is "void of all manner of superstition."<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a>
Moreover, he sustains the requirement of communion, again
quoting Bucer in its favor; accuses Cartwright of weak argument
and of trying to make "schism in the church" by
bringing forward popular customs, "mere trifles" not sanctioned
by the "book" which is the real object of his attack;
and rightly points out that "worship" implies not idolatry,
since it signifies merely to "honor" and not to "adore"
according to the more modern devotional sense.<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> Indeed, it
is historically instructive that already in the sixteenth century
the original meaning of "worship" should have passed
out of common use.</p>

<p>But the attack of the sixteenth-century reformers was not
directed solely against the ceremonies and phrases of the
marriage ritual. A bold step was taken toward civil marriage
when resistance was made to ecclesiastical jurisdiction
in matrimonial causes on the ground that these belong to the
temporal judge. On this subject Cartwright has a characteristic
passage, disclosing his usual ignorance of history and
his confusion of mind&mdash;of which Whitgift does not fail to
take advantage&mdash;but nevertheless revealing plainly enough
the new ideas which more and more came to the front during
the Puritan revolution. "Another thing," he says, "is that
in these courts (which they call spiritual) they take the
knowledge of matters which are mere civil, thereby not only
perverting the order which God hath appointed in severing
the civil causes from the ecclesiastical, but justling also with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
the civil magistrate, and thrusting him from the jurisdiction
which appertaineth unto him, as the causes of the contracts
of marriage, of divorce, of wills and testaments, with divers
other such like things. For, although it appertain to the
church and the gouvernors thereof to shew out of the word
of God which is a lawful contract or just cause of divorce,
and so forth, yet the judicial determination and definitive
sentences of all these do appertain unto the civil magistrate.
Hereunto may be added, that all their punishments almost
are penalties of money, which can by no means appertain to
the church, but is a thing merely civil."<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a></p>

<p>So far as England is concerned, to assign the unfortunate
"severing the civil causes from the ecclesiastical" under
William the Conqueror to the "order which God hath appointed"
may seem to the historical student a trifle bold;
and Whitgift may well retort, if "'it pertain to the church
to declare what is a lawful contract, and which be the just
causes of divorce,' by what reason can you prove 'that the
judicial determination and definitive sentence of those matters
doth pertain to the civil magistrate only'? For is not
he most meet to judge in these causes which best understandeth
them?" But Whitgift himself undoubtedly begs
the question when he advances the counter-statement that
the civil magistrate already has authority in ecclesiastical
cases, since "all jurisdiction that any court in England
hath or doth exercise, be it civil or ecclesiastical," is "executed
in her majesty's name and right," and comes "from
her as supreme governor," so that in effect "we" make no
"such distinction betwixt civil and ecclesiastical causes as the
pope and you do;"<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> for this very blending of church and
state under the "defender of the faith" is really the root of
the whole matter in controversy. Yet Cartwright represents
a good cause, however lame his defense of it may be. Again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
returning to the charge, in effect he attacks the notorious
character<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> of the spiritual courts themselves, referring to the
"unfitness of those which are chief officers" in them; for
"the most" of these officials, he affirms, "are either papists,
or bribers, or drunkards (I know what I write), or epicures,
and such as live of benefices and prebends in England and
in Ireland, doing nothing of those things which appertain
unto them."<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> Dilatory action in matrimonial causes was a
standing grievance against the spiritual courts; and many
"lamentable complaints and petitions" for redress, especially
in cases where "summary hearing and speedy relief" are
necessary, were addressed to the privy council. For this
reason, in 1613, complaints from wives alleging desertion,
cruel treatment, or "breach of the bonds of holy wedlock"
on the part of their husbands were relegated to the High
Commission for settlement.<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>But adding to the powers of the "Ecclesiastical Star
Chamber" would scarcely be regarded by the Puritans as
even a satisfactory palliation for such a grievance. The
policy of the Stuarts tended swiftly to mold their opinions
into organized resistance; and the marriage question became
at last one of the cardinal issues in the reform program.
Thus in the "Millenary Petition" of 1603 the Puritan
ministers, while objecting to the "cross in baptism," the
"cap and surplice," profanation of the Lord's day, "double-beneficed
men," "popish opinions," and "longsomeness of
service," pray also for the reversal of "divers popish canons,"
such "as the restraint of marriage at certain times;" for
greater caution in granting "licenses for marriage without
banns;" and for the correction of "divers terms of priests
and absolution and some other used, with the ring in marriage,
and other such like in the book."<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> On the other
hand, if the Puritan loathed the so-called "popish" tendencies
of the established church, as these became more and
more pronounced under the rule of Laud, both the Puritan
and the Anglican united in merciless persecution of the
adherents of Rome. The act of 1606, "to prevent and
avoid dangers which may grow by Popish recusants," is one
of the most barbarous of those which for ages disgraced the
English statute book. By this law a "popish recusant
convict," or a man whose wife alone is convicted of recusancy,
is forbidden to "exercise any public office in the
commonwealth," except "such husband himself and his
children ... above the age of nine years abiding with
him and his servants in household shall once every month
at the least, not having any reasonable excuse to the
contrary, repair to some church or chapel" of the establishment
and "there hear divine service;" and unless, with his
children and servants of meet age, he receives the sacrament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
of the Lord's Supper when required by law, and "bring up
his children in the true religion." Every married woman
convicted of recusancy, her husband not being so convicted,
who shall not "conform herself ... by the space of one
whole year next before the death of her said husband, shall
forfeit to the King's Majesty ... the issues and profits of
two parts of her jointure and two parts of her dower, ...
and also be disabled to be executrix or administratrix" of
her husband, "and to have ... any part of his goods
and chattels." Any child<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> sent abroad without the king's
license, to prevent his "good education in England or for
any other cause," may have "no benefit by any gift, conveyance,
descent, devise or otherwise of any lands ...
goods or chattels," until he reach the age of eighteen or
more, when, as a condition of recovering his property, he
must take an iron-clad oath of allegiance<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> and partake of
the sacrament. In the meantime&mdash;and here a broad way
was opened up for fraud and wickedness&mdash;all the rights
mentioned are to pass to the "next of kin which shall be no
Popish recusant." Moreover, this infamous statute imposes
harsh penalties upon every recusant who shall hereafter be
"married otherwise than according to the orders of the Church
of England by a minister lawfully authorized." The man is
"utterly disabled to have any estate of freehold in any the
lands ... of his wife as a tenant by curtesy of England,"
or in case she have no lands he must forfeit a hundred pounds.
The woman is not only disabled from claiming her dower or
jointure, but is also denied her "widow's estate and frank-bank
in any customary lands whereof her husband died
seized," as well as any part of her husband's goods "by
virtue of any custom." Should a child be born to them, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
must within a month be baptized in open church according
to Anglican rites, under penalty of one hundred pounds for
refusal.<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> In all other essential features during the first two
Stuart reigns the law of espousals and marriage remained
the same as during the age of Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> After Laud
gained control there was a strong tendency to accent those
parts of the nuptial ceremonial which gave offense to the
Puritans.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> The civil war brought all this to an end; and
"on January 3, 1644-5, a few days before the execution of
Archbishop Laud, the Directory was by a solemn ordinance
substituted for the Book of Common Prayer." But the
form prescribed in the latter remained valid, "although the
celebrant was liable to a fine of £5 for not using the form
inserted in the Directory of Public Worship. Still many
people clung to the ancient service, and amongst others
Stephen Marshall the Preacher, who had a chief hand in
compiling the Directory, deliberately made use of the Prayer
Book in marrying his own daughter, when he paid down to
the churchwardens the legal fine which he had incurred."<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>With the triumph of Cromwell the hour had come for
realization of the new ideals. The act of 1653, though
marking the end of a century of religious controversy in
which not a little of bigotry and fanaticism on both sides is
mingled, and though passed by the much-abused "Barebone's
Parliament,"<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> is nevertheless a measure wise and clear,
resting on principles which two centuries and a half of
subsequent history have fully sanctioned. For, like so
much of the legislation and experimentation of the period,
it is anticipatory of the best reforms of the present age.
With remarkable clearness and brevity, but with adequate
fulness of detail, the form of celebration, the exercise of
matrimonial jurisdiction, and the machinery of administration
are provided for.<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a></p>

<p>An obligatory civil ceremony before a justice of the peace
is prescribed. After due publication of banns, with a proper
certificate thereof obtained from the parish register, the persons
to be married are to come before "some justice of peace
within and of the same county, city, or town corporate"
where publication was made. If either of them is under the
age of twenty-one, "sufficient proof of the consent of their
parents or guardians" must be presented. The magistrate
is required to "examine by witness upon oath, or otherwise
... concerning the truth of the certificate, and due performance
of all the premises;" and he is also to take cognizance
of any "exceptions" to the marriage "made or
arising." If "no reasonable cause to the contrary" appear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
"the marriage shall proceed in this manner: The man to be
married, taking the woman to be married by the hand, shall
plainly and distinctly pronounce these words:</p>

<p>'I A. B. do here in the presence of God the Searcher of
all Hearts, take thee C. D. for my wedded wife; and do also
in the presence of God, and before these witnesses, promise
to be unto thee a Loving and Faithful Husband.'" The
woman in like manner taking the man by the hand accepts
him for her husband, promising to be his "Loving, Faithful,
and Obedient Wife."</p>

<p>The ceremony thus consists merely in the expression
of mutual consent, accompanied by the interlocking of
hands, the old handfasting; but the use of the ring is not
permitted.<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> All legal requirements being satisfied, the justice
pronounces the parties husband and wife; and their
simple declaration, as above given, is to be taken "as to
the form of marriage" to be "good and effective in law;
and no other marriage whatsoever within the Commonwealth,"
after September 29, 1653, "shall be held or accompted
a marriage according to the Laws of England."<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
But this restriction was omitted when the act was confirmed
in 1656.<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a></p>

<p>In thorough harmony with the doctrine that marriage is
a "worldly thing" is the provision of this act depriving the
clergy of jurisdiction in matrimonial causes and placing it in
the hands of the justices of the peace. It is provided that
all "matters and controversies touching contracts and marriages,
and the lawfulness and unlawfulness thereof; and
all exceptions against contracts and marriages, and the distribution
of forfeiture within this act, shall be in the power,
and referred to the determination of the justices of peace
in each county, city, or town corporate, at the general quarter
sessions," or to such "other persons" as the "parliament
shall hereafter appoint." All offenses against the act committed
on or beyond the sea are in like manner to be tried in
the places where the offenders are taken. Jurisdiction in
cases of divorce is not, however, mentioned in this act; nor
was any provision made for the trial of such causes during
the Commonwealth. Indeed, a strong religious prejudice
still survived against divorce, even among the Independents.
"Thus," says Mr. Inderwick, "while on the one hand they
treated marriage as a civil contract, on the other they gave
to it all the inviolability of a sacrament, an inconsistency
which is, however, to be found in many other acts of this
period. The Jewish law, to which they much adhered, provided
for and regulated divorces. They were recognized by
most Protestant communities, and Milton, oppressed by his
own domestic difficulties, had written powerfully on the subject,
but through all the minutes of the various parliaments
and councils of state I find, what I conceive to be somewhat
surprising, no trace of any proposal to introduce into England
any system of divorce. And, indeed, the prejudice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
against divorce appears to have been so strong that the laxity
of the Jews in this respect was found in 1655 to be one of
the strongest arguments against their proposed admission to
the rights of citizenship."<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> Nor is there any clear provision
for the determination of cases of separation and alimony;
although the consistory and other ecclesiastical courts having
been abolished, these questions in practice were managed by
"delegates appointed by the Commissioners of the Great
Seal<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> or by justices of the peace in quarter sessions&mdash;a course
which would seem to have been the reasonable outcome" of
the civil marriage act.<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> On similar grounds the county
justices probably dealt with "matrimonial squabbles," though
in one case at least the intervention of the Council of State
was sought.<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the act of 1653 grants authority to
the justices in cases of the marriage of minors through fraud
or forcible abduction. According to Inderwick, the attempt
to check this abuse was entirely novel. The Commonwealth,
he says, "interfered in a manner<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> hitherto unknown for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
protection of women from those forcible abductions and marriages
which were but too common under the former and
later reigns of the Stuarts. Fraudulent marriages, induced
by needy men or intriguing women, formed the common
staple of the plays and interludes which the puritans so
heartily condemned. In these comedies, while the unhappy
father or deluded guardian was not infrequently the subject
of mirth or of contempt, the lucky intriguer was made the
hero of the play. From this species of offense, carried from
the play-house into private life,<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> the middle class peculiarly
suffered, and while the wealthy merchant or the prosperous
tradesman had to endure as best he might the entrapping of
his daughter or the abduction of his ward, the gay cavalier
or dashing spark who carried her off was the lion of the hour.
Of this phase of society the puritan party had long and
loudly proclaimed their horror and detestation, and the
Commonwealth was not long installed before an occasion
arose which enabled them to give practical effect to their
expressed opinions." This was the case of the forcible
abduction of Jane Pickering, "who was the only daughter and
heiress of Sir Thomas Pickering, knight and baronet,
deceased." While "walking in Greenwich Park with her
maids in October of 1649, she was seized by one Joseph
Walsh and his companions" and transported to Flanders;
"after which Walsh asserted a marriage to have taken place
between them and was prepared to claim his pecuniary rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
as her husband." The Council of State took speedy action.
The lady was eventually brought back to England. Under
authority of an act of Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> the case was tried in 1651
by a special court consisting of delegates appointed by the
Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal; "and it is to be
presumed that she had judgment in her favour, and her marriage
set aside;" for subsequently an "indictment of felony
was found against Walsh and his companions."<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> Accordingly
the marriage act declares that if anyone by violence
or fraud steal or cause to be stolen any person under the
age of twenty-one years, "with intent to marry the said person,"
the offender shall forfeit his whole estate, one-half to
the Commonwealth and one-half to the aggrieved, and besides
"suffer strict and close imprisonment, and be kept to hard
labor ... during life." Severe punishment likewise is
prescribed for those aiding or abetting the crime; and any
guardian or overseer who shall abuse his trust "by seducing,
selling, or otherwise wilfully" promoting the marriage of his
ward with another without such ward's free consent "shall
forfeit double the portion which of right" belongs to the child.<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a></p>

<p>The change in matrimonial jurisdiction effected by this
measure of the Commonwealth has a twofold significance.
Not only is judicial authority thus vested in civil rather than
spiritual tribunals; but it is placed in the hands of local
judges. It is an illustration of the democratic or decentralizing
tendency which marks the legislation of the seventeenth-century
Puritans on both sides of the Atlantic. It was,
moreover, natural that the county magistrates should be
vested with these new functions. In the exercise of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
general peace authority they had already performed duties
not wholly dissimilar to some of those called for under the
act. In certain instances, before as well as after the reign
of Cromwell, one may be surprised to find the justices exercising
a sort of jurisdiction in cases of alleged breach of
promise. "Forasmuch," declare the magistrates of Devon
in 1626, "as it hath apeared unto this court that Bridget
Howsley of Langton, spinster, liveth idly and lewdly at home,
not betaking herself to any honest course of life, and hath
lately falsely and scandalously accused" a certain man of
Honiton, "challenging a promise of marriage from him,
which tended much to his disgrace, and that she is a continual
brawler and sower of strife and debate between neighbors;"
therefore it is ordered that the said Bridget "be
forthwith committed to the House of Correction there to be set
on work and remain for the space of six whole months," and
thereafter until she find good sureties or a "master that will
take her into service."<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> Here the justices may have acted
merely as peace officers, though it is plain that as a precedent
their sentence is far-reaching in its consequences. As
late as 1835 we find the magistrates at Exeter, following the
principle of the Roman law, "obliging a faithless swain to
return a damsel's watch, and the latter to return half the
value of a broach" which he had given her.<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a></p>

<p>In no respect is the essential "modernness" of Cromwell's
marriage act more strikingly shown than in its provisions
to secure publicity, with a safe and perfect record.
Nothing so wise and practical in this regard was again seen
in England until the law of 1836. It is provided that in
each parish a register of marriages, births, and deaths shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
be elected for three years by the contributors to the poor
rate. The register is to be an "able and honest person,"
such "as shall be sworn and approved" by a justice of the
peace, who is to enter the fact of election and qualification
in the register book of the parish;<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> and he is removable
either by the justice or by the parish with the justice's
consent. A "Book of good Vellum or Parchment" is to be
provided by each parish, in which it is the duty of the
register to enter all marriages, births, and burials of "all
sorts of people."<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a></p>

<p>Careful provision is also made for the publication of
banns. All marriages must be announced either for three
successive Sundays in church, or at the pleasure of the
parties, during the same interval, in the market-place<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a>
"next to the said church or chappel." Before the publication
the parties must file with the register a written statement
of their names and places of residence, together with
those of their parents or guardians; and these facts are
then included in the notice. The register also enters the
fact of publication and all objections brought forward
against the marriage, with the names of those objecting.
After publication the persons to be married are to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
the register's certificate of the fact and proceed to a justice
of the peace. As already seen, they must also find witnesses,
give evidence of the consent of parents or guardians, and
cause to be confirmed by oath, or otherwise in the discretion
of the magistrate, the genuineness of the certificate. After
the ceremony, if desired by the parties, the officiating justice
is required to give them a certificate of the solemnization
properly signed by himself and the witnesses; and this
certificate, if produced, shall be recorded by the clerk of the
peace in each county in a book of parchment provided for the
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> The register of the parish is to "attend the said
justice" to "subscribe the entry of every such marriage."</p>

<p>Nor did the system so well planned exist merely upon
paper. The plain men chosen to the office of register did
their work well, though they were sneered at as "mere
laymen," and though they sometimes substitute rather harsh
English for the worse Latin of their clerical predecessors.
Greater publicity and more orderly records were secured
during the Commonwealth than existed before it or after
the Restoration. "It has been frequently asserted by
writers on this subject," remarks Burn, a thoroughly competent
judge, "that the registers during the time of Oliver
Cromwell, were very badly kept;" but, on the contrary,
"they were unusually well kept" where "a lay register was
appointed according to the act of parliament." Such
deficiencies as exist, he suggests, may result either from
the destruction of the records or from neglect to turn them
over at the Restoration or when the lay registers entered
upon their functions.<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> Waters agrees with Burn;<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> and an
examination of the published parish registers entirely confirms
this view.<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> It is hard, therefore, to understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
following curious statement by a contemporary writer who
is clearly no admirer of Cromwell.<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> Referring to certain
"bills of mortality" for Romsey in Hampshire and Tiverton
in Devonshire,<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> he remarks "that in the years 1648 and
1649, being the time when the people of <em>England</em> did most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
resent the horrid Parricide of his late Sacred Majesty,
... there were but nine weddings ... in the same
places, when there were ordinarily between 30 and 40 <em>per
Annum</em>; and but 16, when there were ordinarily ...
between 50 and 60. And it may also be observed that
something of this black murther appeared in the years 1643
and 1644 when the Civil war was at the highest, but the
contrary [in the] years 1654, 1655, etc., to prevent the new
way of Marriage then imposed upon the people." Just how
the increase in the number of weddings recorded in the years
1654-58 may be explained as due to a desire "to prevent the
new way of Marriage," we are not informed. It cannot be
inferred that people hurried to get married in anticipation
of the new law, for it was put in force the next month after
its passage; nor that through zeal they married more rapidly
according to the Book of Common Prayer, in defiance of the
new civil forms, although in some cases the religious celebration
may have been still employed. But it is useless to
speculate as to the sense of the passage. The statistical tables
for the two parishes submitted by this writer afford very
strong evidence that the apparent increase in the number of
weddings is mainly due to the fact that the records were
better kept. It will be noticed that there is a corresponding
rise in the number of christenings and burials; and this fact
can scarcely be accounted for by assuming that people
hastened to get born or to die through opposition to an
ordinance of the Barebone's Parliament. After the Restoration
there is a decided falling off in the registration.</p>

<p>The great success of this early attempt at reform in
matrimonial administration cannot, however, be thoroughly
appreciated unless one reflects that throughout the ages the
matter of registration had been shamefully neglected and
the record books recklessly destroyed. Their custody being
"frequently committed to ignorant parish clerks, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
no idea of their utility beyond their being occasionally the
means of putting a shilling into their pockets for furnishing
extracts;" and "at other times being under the superintendence
of an incumbent, either forgetful, careless, or
negligent, the result has necessarily been that many
registers are miserably defective."<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> This judgment applies
to the times following the Commonwealth as well as to the
period falling between 1538 and the act of 1653.<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a></p>

<p>Many specimens of the marriage records of the Commonwealth
have been discovered, representing each phase of
procedure.<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> Of these the following entry of the marriage of
Oliver Cromwell's daughter, taken by Waters from the register
of St. Martin's in the Fields, may serve as an example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These are to certifie whom it may concerne, that according
to a late Act of Parliament ... Publication was made
in the publique meeting place, in the Parish Church of the
parish of Martins in the Fields in the county of Middlesex,
upon three several Lord's Days, at the close of the morning
exercise, namely, upon the XXV. day of October MDCLVII.,
as alsoe upon the I. and VIII. day of November following,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
of a marriage agreed upon between the Honorable Robert
Rich of Andrew's Holborn, and the Right Honorable the
Lady Frances Cromwell, of Martins in the Fields, in the
county of Middlesex. All which was fully performed according
to the Act without exception.</p>

<p>"In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand the
IX. day of November, MDCLVII.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows this entry "in the hand of Henry Scobell"
who was doubtless the officiating magistrate:<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the entries are fuller in details, and more
ingenious in orthography. Here is one from the register
of "Inglebye iuxta Grenhow":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"George Middleton of the Parish of Carleton husbandmā,
son of William Middleton of the same parish husbandman
&amp; Isabell Easebie of Green-howe in the parish of Inglebye
spinster daughter of Isabell Easbie of the said Greenhowe;

</p></blockquote>

<p>Each of the two documents just presented, it will be
noticed, consists of two parts: the certificate of the register
to the magistrate; and the magistrate's entry in the register
book after the ceremony has been performed. The following
is an example of the marriage certificate which by the act the
justice is to deliver to the parties, when required, to be filed
by them with the county clerk of the peace, if they see fit:</p>

<blockquote>

</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>
<p>The law of 1653, it thus appears, constitutes a singularly
important episode in the social and religious history of England.
It remained in force, with a modification in 1656,
during the seven years preceding the fall of the Commonwealth,
and called forth the fierce opposition and hatred of
the royalist party. It was ridiculed by the pamphleteer<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> and

Marriage is made a "traffic" because published in the market-place;
"matrimony and hanging" join hands before the same
justice; and the "lay register" comes in for his full share of
abuse. "Levellers and phanaticks," sadly complains one
writer, "blush not at their own rushing into other men's
offices,&mdash;a bold but witless Justice of y<sup>e</sup> Peace, makes his
neighbouring ministers cyphers, whilst he forceth y<sup>e</sup> King's
subjects (quite against the graine) to elect and he to confirm
a mere layman in the office of Parish Register&mdash;<i>Proh pudor

while in 1659, the clerical register of Christ's
Church, Hants, spitefully declares that "maryinge by justices,
election of registers by Parishioners, and the use of
ruling elders, first came into fashion in the time of rebellion,
under that monster of nature and bludy tyrant, Oliver
Cromwell."<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand the principles of this measure found a
mighty champion in Milton, in whose writings, says Friedberg,
the religious tendencies of his party were molded almost
into a "scientific system."<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> The following extract from
"The likeliest means to remove Hirelings out of the Church"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
is interesting as epitomizing the views of the Independents,
showing that they were grounded upon the fundamental
principles of Old English custom:</p>

<p>"As for marriages, that ministers should meddle with
them, as not sanctified or legitimate without their celebration,
I find no ground in scripture either of precept or
example. Likeliest it is (which our Selden hath well
observed l. II, c. 58, ux. Eb.) that in imitation of heathen
priests, who were wont at nuptials to use many rites and
ceremonies, and especially, judging it would be profitable,
and the increase of their authority, not to be spectators only
in business of such concernment to the life of man, they
insinuated that marriage was not holy without their benediction,
and for the better colour, made it a sacrament; being
of itself a civil ordinance, a house hold contract, a thing
indifferent and free to the whole race of mankind, not as
religious, but as men: best, indeed, undertaken to religious
ends, and, as the apostle saith, I Cor. VII., 'in the Lord.'
Yet not therefore invalid or unholy without a minister and
his pretended necessary hallowing, more than any other act,
enterprise, or contract of civil life, which ought all to be
done also in the Lord and to his glory: all which, no less
than marriage, were by the cunning of priests heretofore, as
material to their profit, transacted at the altar. Our divines
deny it to be a sacrament; yet retained the celebration, till
prudently a late parliament recovered the civil liberty of
marriage from their encroachment, and transferred the
ratifying and registering thereof from the canonical shop
to the proper cognizance of civil magistrates."<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a></p>

<p>After the Restoration, though not expressly repealed, the
act of Cromwell was at once superseded by the laws in force
before the Revolution. The more revengeful faction of the
royalists even strove to have all marriages contracted under
the act made null and void. But a proposition so monstrous
could not prevail; and a statute legalizing civil marriages
was passed during the first year of Charles II.<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a></p>


<h3>II. FLEET MARRIAGES AND THE HARDWICKE ACT, 1753</h3>

<p>In order to understand the cumulative influences which
finally in the middle of the eighteenth century produced the
next English statute prescribing a definite form for marriages,
it will be necessary to point out the anomalies of the
old system which during the period between the Restoration
and that time led to abuses of a most startling character.</p>

<p>Previous to the reign of William III. only spiritual
punishment had been imposed for secret marriages; but
under that monarch begins a series of acts which, though
chiefly intended as revenue measures, in effect prescribed
also temporal penalties. The first of these statutes<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a> was
that of 1694 which imposed on all marriages a direct tax,
graduated according to the rank of the parties. To facilitate
the enforcement of the law the clergy were required to keep
registers to which the tax collectors should have access.
But there were certain churches which had long claimed to
be exempt from the episcopal visitations, and therefore they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
now claimed to be free from the operation of the statute
which had only made the marriage business of their incumbents
more profitable by removing competition.<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> A supplementary
act was therefore passed in the following year,<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a>
including such places and requiring that all marriages
should be solemnized only after publication of banns or
obtaining the bishop's license, under penalty of one hundred
pounds for the first and three years' suspension from office
for the second violation of the law by any clergyman.<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> But
even this measure was inadequate. It had not been foreseen
that there were clergymen not comprehended under the
titles "parsons, vicars, and curates" enumerated in the
statute. These were actually benefited by the act.<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> By
connivance on the part of the regular clergy such ministers
were able to evade the law. They "do substitute and
employ," runs the act of 1696, "and knowingly and wittingly
suffer and permit, diverse other Ministers to marry
great Numbers of Persons in their respective Churches and
Chapels without Publication of Banns or Licenses of marriage
first had and obtained; many of which Ministers so
substituted, employed, permitted and suffered to marry, as
aforesaid, have no Benefices or settled Habitations, and are
poor and indigent, and cannot easily be discovered and convicted
of the Offences aforesaid: And whereas Ministers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
being in Prison for Debt or otherwise, do marry in the said
Prisons, many Persons resorting thither for the Purposes
aforesaid, and in other Places for Lucre and Gain to themselves,"<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a>
therefore the one hundred pounds' penalty prescribed
in the former statute is extended to these cases,<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a>
and a fine of ten pounds is imposed on every man married
without banns or license.</p>



<p>The last paragraph of the above quotation is interesting
as being perhaps the first statutory reference to the celebrated
"Fleet" marriages, which constitute one of the most
astonishing chapters that the history of ecclesiastical administration
can produce. The Fleet, as is well known, was
the prison in which formerly all prisoners for debt from
the entire kingdom were, or could demand to be, confined.
On account of the scant accommodation for the vast number
congregated there, it became customary to allow those who
could give security for appearance in the prison when summoned
to take private lodgings or set up a private establishment
anywhere within the "rules of liberties" of the
Fleet&mdash;a portion of London of considerable area and well
defined limits.<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> The Fleet had a chapel with a regular
chaplain of its own, who sometimes eked out his income
through fees for fraudulent and clandestine marriages.<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
here were confined among others many clergymen, some of
whom made a regular business of celebrating marriages;
and they had to compete with other parsons, often disreputable
men, perhaps deprived of their places or benefices for
misconduct, who took up their abode in the precincts of the
Fleet to gain a living from the disgraceful traffic in matrimony.
Even laymen may have sought a share in the profits;
and these, like the others, did not fail to wear the priestly
"cassock, gown, and bands,"<a name="FNanchor_1351_1351" id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> in order to impose upon the
unwary. The ceremony was not performed in church, but
in the private rooms of the parson. Often an office or
marriage shop was opened and a big sign-board hung out
announcing the business and commending the quality of
service rendered within,<a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> while standing advertisements were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
also kept in the newspapers. The following notice of his
business by parson Lando is quoted by Friedberg from the
<cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>, 1749:</p>

<p>"Marriages with a Licence, Certificate and a Crown Stamp,
at a Guinea, at the New Chapel, next door to the China Shop,
near Fleet Bridge, London, by a regular bred Clergyman,
and not by a Fleet Parson as is insinuated in the public
papers; and that the Town may bee freed mistakes, no
Clergyman being a prisoner in the Rules of the Fleet dare
marry; and to obviate all doubts, this chapel is not in the
verge of the Fleet, but kept by a Gentleman who was lately
Chaplain on board one of his Majesty's men-of-war, and likewise
has gloriously distinguished himself in defence of his
King and Country, and is above committing those little
mean actions that some men impose on people, being determined
to have every think conducted with the utmost decency
and regularity, such as shall be always supported in law and
equity."<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a></p>

<p>Pennant, in his <cite>Account of London</cite>, written "at the end
of the last century," gives us a realistic picture of the Fleet
parson. "In walking along the street, in my youth, on the
side next to the prison, I have often been tempted by the
question, <em>Sir, will you be pleased to walk in and be married?</em>
Along this most lawless space was hung up the frequent sign
of a male and female hand conjoined, with, <em>Marriages performed
within</em>, written beneath. A dirty fellow invited you
in. The parson was seen walking before his shop; a squalid
profligate figure, clad in tattered plaid night gown, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
fiery face, and ready to couple you for a dram of gin, or roll
of tobacco."<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, various taverns, for the sake of the profit derived
from the festivities connected with weddings, kept
salaried Fleet parsons or others in their employ and made
announcement of this extra accommodation also by a sign
containing the businesslike inscription: "Marriages performed
here."<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> Literally thousands of marriages were celebrated
by Fleet parsons every year. A single priest, John
Gainham,<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> between the years 1709 and 1740, during which
he was confined, "solemnized" thirty-six thousand marriages,
though he had many competitors.<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> Not only the Fleet prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
and the lower classes of the city, but many persons of
noble titles and illustrious names are enumerated among
their customers.<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> The question naturally arises: What were
the causes of this singular phenomenon? There were several
inducements to the patronage of Fleet parsons, chief of which
were the superior cheapness and avoidance of publicity.<a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a>
Smaller fees and no banns were required. Besides parental
consent, which was indispensable for minors in regular marriages,
was unnecessary in the Fleet. Moreover, it was a
popular error of the times that a woman by marriage ceased
to be liable for debts previously contracted.<a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of course, frightful abuses grew out of this
system. Registers were kept, but they were often falsified
and were of little value as evidence. False oaths by the
score were taken by parsons.<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> Young girls were abducted
and carried before some clerical scoundrel of the Fleet and
forcibly married for the sake of the fees.<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> Persons were
enticed by "plyers" or touts<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> into ale-houses, made drunk,
and married while in this condition.<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> Of course, now and
then a case of unusual flagrancy attracted the attention of
the public, and the criminals were brought to justice. But
it is a sad commentary on the moral debasement and utter
formalism of the English church during the first half of the
eighteenth century that no serious attempt seems to have
been made to deprive these monsters of their priestly character.
The existing civil laws were powerless to remedy the
evil. The Fleet parson could practically bid them defiance.<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a>
In the lively words of Friedberg, "what could befall him
according to existing legislation? Ought the bishop to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
remove him from office? That had already occurred when he
was dragged from his living to prison. Ought his spiritual
superior to have him locked up? He was already a prisoner.
Should he be mulcted in a sum of money? He had none."<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a></p>

<p>There were also other places in which the same irregularities
existed.<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> Among these were Tyburn, the Tower,<a name="FNanchor_1368_1368" id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a>
the King's Bench prison, and a chapel in Mayfair. In the
latter place Rev. Alexander Keith, whom Horace Walpole
styles the "marriage broker,"<a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> performed each year on the
average six thousand marriages, while in the neighboring
church of St. Anne only fifty regular contracts were solemnized.
We can easily credit the statement that he derived
therefrom a "very bishopric of revenue."<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> When finally
the Hardwicke act put an end to his traffic, he declared, with
many oaths, that he would not be outdone by the bishops,
but would buy a piece of ground and "under-bury them."<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a>
Keith himself has left behind what Ashton thinks is a "plain
unvarnished tale" of Fleet marriages. In a pamphlet written
at the time Lord Hardwicke's act was under discussion he
says: "As I have married many thousands, and, consequently,
have on these occasions seen the humour of the lower class
of people, I have often asked the married pair how long
they had been acquainted; they would reply, some more,
some less, but the generality did not exceed the acquaintance
of a week, some only of a day, half a day, etc.... Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
inconvenience which will arise from this Act will be, that the
expence<a name="FNanchor_1372_1372" id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> of being married will be so great, that few of the
lower class of people can afford; for I have often heard a
Flete parson say, that many have come to be married when
they have but half-a-crown in their pockets, and sixpence to
buy a pot of beer, and for which they have pawned some of
their cloaths.... I remember once on a time, I was at a
public house at Radcliffe, which was then full of Sailors and
their girls, there was fiddling, piping, jigging, and eating;
at length one of the tars starts up" and swore he would "be
married just now," with a rough jest. "The joke took, and
in less than two hours ten couple set out for the Flete. I
staid their return. They returned in coaches; five women
in each coach; the tars, some running before, others riding
on the coach box, and others behind. The Cavalcade being
over, the couples went up into an upper room, where they
concluded the evening with great jollity. The next time I
went that way, I called on my landlord and asked him concerning
this marriage adventure: he at first stared at me,
but, recollecting, he said those things were so frequent, that
he hardly took any notice of them; for, added he, it is a
common thing, when a fleet comes in, to have two or three
hundred marriages in a week's time, among the sailors."<a name="FNanchor_1373_1373" id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>Several other interesting descriptions of these disgraceful
"operations" have been handed down. Such are the sprightly
verses entitled the "Bunter's Wedding;"<a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> and especially the
realistic account of the abduction of her friend given by an
anonymous writer in the <cite>Grub Street Journal</cite> for January
15, 1735.<a name="FNanchor_1375_1375" id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> But the most eloquent testimony of all is afforded
by the Fleet registers, many of which are still preserved.<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a>

<p>Long before the middle of the eighteenth century it is
very clear there was crying need of thoroughgoing reform
in the marriage laws of England. To the surviving disorders
arising in mediæval theory had come new ones of
more modern growth. For, besides the shameful irregularities
of the Fleet, clandestine contracts, either through
the help of "hedge parsons"<a name="FNanchor_1379_1379" id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> or else by simple agreement
of the parties, illegal but not invalid, were still freely practiced
throughout the kingdom. From 1666 onward during
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries efforts were repeatedly
made to provide a remedy by legislation; but no
bill succeeded in passing both houses of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_1380_1380" id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
legislation of William and Anne, already referred to, proved
an encouragement rather than a hindrance to clandestine
unions. The rivalry of the prisons, "lawless" churches, and
the regular Fleet chaplain was thus removed; conviction for
breach of the statutes was rendered exceedingly difficult;
and the increased expense caused by the tax upon licenses
favored the business of parsons who were ready to "solemnize"
marriages at low rates and without troublesome or
costly conditions.<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> Even the notorious cases of Haagen
Swendsen in 1702 and "Beau" Feilding in 1706, though
calling sharp attention of the public to the frightful
dangers lurking in the matrimonial laws, were not enough
to quicken the conscience of the nation.<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> A timely edition
of Dr. Gally's sensible book<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> in 1750 did something to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
educate the public mind; and finally in 1753 the celebrated
case of Cochrane <i>v.</i> Campbell,<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> originating in Scotland, came
in the last instance before the House of Lords. The validity
of a marriage which had been legally celebrated and which
had continued for nearly thirty years was challenged on
account of previous secret <i>sponsalia de praesenti</i>. Save
for lack of evidence of the alleged prior contract, "the wife
who in true love during so long a time had been devoted
to her husband, though already dead," would have been
"degraded to the position of a concubine, the children
begotten in marriage branded as bastards, and robbed of
their inheritance."<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> This case proved to be the proximate
cause of the passage of the famous Hardwicke act of 1753.
On January 31 of that year, on motion of Lord Bath, the
House of Lords decided to bring in a "Bill for the better
preventing of Clandestine Marriage." The drafting of the
bill was intrusted to the twelve judges, but the draft presented
by them was so imperfect, that the chancellor, Lord
Hardwicke, undertook its thorough revision.<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a></p>

<p>With little resistance the revised bill was readily passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
through the Lords, the bishops even yielding their assent.
But in the Commons it came to its final passage on June 6,
1753, only after a long and stormy contest. The press and
the people participated in the excitement;<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> and the tenacity
of the old custom of private espousals is shown by the fact
that the large majority of the latter were opposed to the
measure, though this may in part be accounted for on
the ground of its intolerance toward the dissenters. In
the lower house the bill was ably supported by Attorney-General
Ryder, Lord Barrington, the Earl of Hillsborough,
Solicitor-General Murray, and by Mr. John Bond whose
speech is remarkable for its strong argument and sober
common-sense. Most prominent on the other side were Mr.
Nugent, Colonel George Haldane, Charles Townshend, and,
in particular, Henry Fox who in 1744 had himself contracted
a clandestine marriage in the Fleet with the daughter of the
Duke of Richmond.<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> Another bitter antagonist of the bill
was Horace Walpole, "two members of whose family were
known to have entered matrimony by uncanonical wedlock,
and one of whose nieces, several years after the enactment of
Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Bill, became the bride of the most
famous Fleet marriage on record."<a name="FNanchor_1389_1391" id="FNanchor_1389_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1391" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> The arguments in support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
of the measure are direct, practical, and convincing;
those of its opposers for the most part, except as directed to
faults of detail, seem captious, forced, or even frivolous,
when looked at in the light of modern experience. When
they saw that the bill was likely to pass, they sought to make
it obnoxious by mutilation and amendment.<a name="FNanchor_1390_1392" id="FNanchor_1390_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1392" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a></p>

<p>In favor of the measure the notorious scandals and hardships
caused by clandestine contracts are dwelt upon. "How
often," exclaims the Attorney-General, "have we known a
rich heiress carried off by a man of low birth, or perhaps by
an infamous sharper? What distress some of our best
families have been brought into, what ruin some of their
sons or daughters have been involved in, by such means,
every gentleman may from his own knowledge recollect."<a name="FNanchor_1391_1393" id="FNanchor_1391_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1393" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>
The bill, it is urged, provides an effective remedy for the
evil. This remedy is publicity; and it can be secured only
by making banns or license, with parental consent, followed
by a solemn public celebration at the proper time and place,
the absolute condition of a valid marriage. The practical
success of such a system is proved by reference to Dutch
experience. For the law of Holland is even stricter than
the proposed measure. "In Holland," says Mr. Bond, "a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
regular proclamation of banns ... is so necessary, that a
marriage without it is absolutely void, without any decree
or sentence of any court for declaring it so;" and after
publication the parties must be "married in the church or
chapel of the religion<a name="FNanchor_1392_1394" id="FNanchor_1392_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1394" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> to which they belong; neither of
which can be dispensed with but by the supreme court of
Holland with respect to the nobility, or by the supreme
magistrate of their city with respect to the other inhabitants;
so that ... no license can be granted, either as to the
proclamation of banns, or as to not being married at church,
by any ecclesiastical court whatsoever."<a name="FNanchor_1393_1395" id="FNanchor_1393_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1395" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> Nor does the state
overstep its proper authority when a marriage is rendered
void for neglect to observe its prescribed forms. No violence
is thus done to the "sanctity" of the marriage bond; for the
canonical doctrine of the sacramental or indissoluble nature
of matrimony is not sustained by an appeal either to history
or to common-sense.<a name="FNanchor_1394_1396" id="FNanchor_1394_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1396" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> "I think it is ridiculous to say,"
declares one speaker, "that infants shall have a power, when
they come of age, to avoid and annul every contract they
made, while under age, without the consent of their parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
or guardians, and yet if without consent of father or mother,
or guardian, they dispose of themselves and every thing that
belongs to them in marriage whilst under age, they shall
have no power to avoid that contract when they come of age,
let it be never so fraudulent, pernicious or infamous. This
is adding a sanctity to the marriage contract, which is
inconsistent with the good of every society, and with the
happiness of mankind in general."<a name="FNanchor_1395_1397" id="FNanchor_1395_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1397" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a></p>

<p>On the other side, every merit claimed for the bill by its
friends is changed into a fault. The evil of secret espousals
is minimized or even denied. Charles Townshend, whose
argument is singularly forced and superficial, boldly asserts
that "clandestine marriages cannot properly in themselves
be called a public evil, and as they are of different kinds,
they ought to have a different consideration." There are, he
says, four varieties. Those that are equal both as to rank
and fortune "cannot be called a public evil, because they are
generally the most happy, and such as parents ought to
approve of, and would approve of, if not governed by some
whim or caprice.... As to those that are unequal with
respect to fortune, they are so far from being a public evil,
that they are a public benefit, because they serve to disperse
the wealth of the kingdom through the whole body of the
people, and to prevent the accumulating and monopolizing it
into a few hands; which is an advantage to every society,
especially a free and trading society. The same may be
said of clandestine marriages that are unequal both as to
rank and fortune," for they are still more leveling in their
effects; as when "a lord of good estate" marries "a taylor's
or a shoemaker's daughter of good character, though not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
worth a groat," or a "lady of quality, entitled to a good
estate," marries such a man's son who is honorable but poor.
Such marriages are a public blessing. "Nay I will go farther,"
he adds, "such marriages seldom, if ever, bring shame
or misery upon the contracting parties." Only the secret
marriages which are properly called "scandalous and infamous"
are a public evil; such as are entered into between a
gentleman of character and an abandoned woman, or between
a reputable lady and "a notorious rogue or common sharper."
But "how rarely do such infamous marriages happen, especially
with respect to those under age."<a name="FNanchor_1396_1398" id="FNanchor_1396_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1398" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> In fact, throughout
the argument of the opposition every change is rung on the
objection that the bill is aristocratic and plutocratic in its
motive. Elopement, even through the connivance of a Fleet
parson, is practically elevated into the chief security of
democracy and the necessary safety-valve of human passion.
Should the bill pass and the advantage of secretly contracting
a valid marriage be thus taken away, the nobility "will
in a great measure secure all the great heiresses in the kingdom
to those of their own body. An old miser, even of the
lowest birth, is generally ambitious of having his only daughter
married to a lord, and a guardian has generally some
selfish view, or some interest to serve, by getting his rich
ward married to the eldest son of some duke, marquiss, or
earl; so that when a young commoner makes his addresses
to a rich heiress, he has no friend but his superior merit, and
that little deity called love," whose counsel, but for the proposed
law, she may harken to in tender youth, but whose
influence over her decreases "as she increases in years; for
by the time she comes of age, pride and ambition seize possession
of her heart likewise;" so that as a result hereafter, if
the bill pass, "no commoner will ever marry a rich heiress,
unless his father be a minister of state, nor will a peer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
eldest son marry the daughter of a commoner, unless she be
a rich heiress."<a name="FNanchor_1397_1399" id="FNanchor_1397_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1399" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> Furthermore, close intermarrying among
the rich and noble will cause degeneration. "What sort of
breed their offspring will be, we may easily judge: if the
gout, the gravel, the pox, and madness are always to wed
together, what a hopeful generation of quality and rich commoners
shall we have amongst us." Then, too, a social caste
will be developed in England, such as the distinction between
<i>noblesse</i> and <i>roturiers</i> abroad, especially in France, where
the marriages of the "quality" are something like those of
"sovereign princes: the bride and bridegroom sometimes
have never seen one another, till they meet to be married;"
hence in that country gallantry has taken the place of "conjugal
love and fidelity."<a name="FNanchor_1398_1400" id="FNanchor_1398_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1400" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> Nay, the sinister effects of the
proposed measure in this regard are not exhausted even by
this dark prophecy. Coming to the rescue, another ingenious
logician shows conclusively that through the increase of
wealth, which means political power, the lords, following the
Venetian example, may overmaster the commons, subvert
the free constitution, and set up a despotic oligarchy in its
place.<a name="FNanchor_1399_1401" id="FNanchor_1399_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1401" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a></p>

<p>But the obstacles placed by the bill in the way of free
wedlock will have still other disastrous consequences.
Marriage will be discouraged among the lower orders,
particularly the industrious poor, while at the same time
immorality through illicit unions will be vastly increased.
The state will thus suffer through the check put upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
growth of its best population.<a name="FNanchor_1400_1402" id="FNanchor_1400_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1402" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> For the bill not only places
tyrannical power in the hands of parents or guardians by
making their consent necessary to a valid marriage,<a name="FNanchor_1401_1403" id="FNanchor_1401_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1403" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a> but
passionate lovers even when of full age will not wait for the
publication of banns, while the poor will be unable to pay
for a license.<a name="FNanchor_1402_1404" id="FNanchor_1402_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1404" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> The proposed law, according to Haldane,
"will really prove a sort of prohibition of marriage with
respect to all our poorer sort of people, because it will
render the solemnization of that ceremony so tedious and
troublesome, or so expensive, that many of them will chuse
to live single, or agree to live together without any marriage
at all. We know how averse our people generally are to a
proclamation of banns, even in the present method, when in
any of our holiday weeks the whole may be performed, and
the loving couple made happy ... in three or four days;
how much more averse, then, will they be in this way of
marrying, when they must give a week's notice before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
banns can be first proclaimed, and after that must wait above
three weeks before the proclamation ... can be finished
and the marriage ceremony performed?" The natural
result will be the increase of sexual vice.<a name="FNanchor_1403_1405" id="FNanchor_1403_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1405" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a> Townshend presents
a similar argument, though some of his forebodings
were fully justified by future events. The bill instead of
preventing polygamy&mdash;by which he means bigamy&mdash;will
encourage it; "for it prescribes so many formalities for
rendering a marriage good and valid in law, that a cunning
fellow will always take care to have some of them omitted,"
so that he cannot be convicted of a breach of the statute.
Marriage will still be difficult of proof; and by encouraging
false promises of marriage the bill sets a cruel snare for the
feet of the innocent.<a name="FNanchor_1404_1406" id="FNanchor_1404_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1406" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a> "As the law now stands, if a treacherous
young fellow should refuse to perform such a promise,
the young woman who trusted to it may sue him in an
ecclesiastical court, where she may put him on his oath, and
if he confesses the promise, or she can otherwise prove it,
he must either marry her, or be imprisoned upon the writ
<i>de excommunicato capiendo</i>." But under the proposed act
"she can have no relief: the statute of frauds and perjuries
will be a bar to her action at common law, unless she has
been so cautious as to take a promise in writing; even then,
if he was under age, his nonage will be a bar to her action;
and suppose him of age"&mdash;and here the distinguished member
of the House of Commons takes a tone which like a
flash reveals the political torpor of the English people and
of the Whig oligarchy of George II.&mdash;"she must submit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
have a price put upon her honor and virtue by a jury of
tradesmen, few of whom are accustomed to deal in that
commodity." But, with Colonel Haldane, he believes, of
all the evil consequences of the act "that of preventing
marriage and promoting fornication among our industrious
poor will be most pernicious."<a name="FNanchor_1405_1407" id="FNanchor_1405_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1407" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> Yet how simple would be
the proper remedy<a name="FNanchor_1406_1408" id="FNanchor_1406_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1408" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a> for the defects of the present marriage
laws!</p>

<p>In concluding the summary of this debate, singularly
illustrative of the imaginary evils so often conjured up
against reform measures, the deep-seated prejudice of the
English people to publicity in matrimonial engagements
should be noted. It seems that in 1753, as well as in 1653
and 1836, the open procedure prescribed by the law gave a
certain shock to popular sentiment. "It is a peculiar phenomenon,"
says Friedberg, "that the English nation, whose
whole political system is interpenetrated by the principle of
publicity, should look upon publicity in the formation of
marriage as positively improper; that it should regard the
publication of banns ... as an unjustifiable violation of
modesty."<a name="FNanchor_1407_1409" id="FNanchor_1407_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1409" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> In this spirit Horace Walpole, ridiculing the
Hardwicke act, writes to Hon. Seymour Conway: "It is well
you are married. How would my lady A&mdash;&mdash; have liked to
be asked in a parish-church for three Sundays running?
I really believe she would have worn her weeds forever,
rather than have passed through so impudent a ceremony."<a name="FNanchor_1408_1410" id="FNanchor_1408_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1410" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
According to Mr. Nugent, "it is certain, that proclamation
of banns and a public marriage is against the genius and
nature of our people; it shocks the modesty of a young girl
to have it proclaimed through the parish, that she is going
to be married; and a young fellow does not like to be exposed
so long beforehand to the jeers of all his companions."<a name="FNanchor_1409_1411" id="FNanchor_1409_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1411" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> In
fact, without defending banns as an ideal institution, one
cannot help reflecting that the final triumph of civil marriage
has already done something to overcome the false delicacy
touching human sexual relations and responsibilities, whose
survival in modern society is nevertheless still a serious
hindrance to rational education.</p>

<p>By the statute of 1753,<a name="FNanchor_1410_1412" id="FNanchor_1410_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1412" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> whose origin has now been considered,
all marriages, save those of Quakers and Jews or
those of members of the royal family, are to be celebrated
only after publication of banns or license, and only during
the canonical hours<a name="FNanchor_1411_1413" id="FNanchor_1411_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411_1413" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> in an Anglican church or chapel where
"banns of matrimony have been usually published," and
before an Anglican clergyman. To solemnize marriage in
any other manner or in any other place, or without banns
except by special license of the archbishop, is punished with
fourteen years' transportation, and the marriage is declared
void. Two or more witnesses must be present. The clergy
are required to keep registers, and the falsifying or destroying
the same is punished by death. In the case of banns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
the express consent of parent or guardian for the marriage
of minors is not required. Such a marriage is legal when
dissent has not been expressed.<a name="FNanchor_1412_1414" id="FNanchor_1412_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1414" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> But in the case of license
the marriage of a minor&mdash;not being a widow or a widower&mdash;without
the consent of parent or guardian is absolutely
void.<a name="FNanchor_1413_1415" id="FNanchor_1413_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1415" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> Furthermore, the act declares that persons convicted
of solemnizing "matrimony in prisons and other places without
publication of banns or license" shall be judged guilty of
felony and sentenced to fourteen years' transportation, while
the marriages so solemnized are absolutely null and void.
Precontracts are likewise abolished. "In no case whatsoever
shall any suit or proceeding be had in any ecclesiastical
court in order to compel a celebration of marriage <i>in facie
ecclesiae</i>, by reason of any contract ... whether <i>per verba
de praesenti</i> or <i>per verba de futuro</i>."</p>

<p>The general effect of the Hardwicke act was undoubtedly
good. Publicity was secured. "It destroyed the infamous
trade of the Fleet Prison and Mayfair parsons;<a name="FNanchor_1414_1416" id="FNanchor_1414_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1416" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> it enforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
a regular public celebration after compliance with certain
preliminary forms," and it established the principle of
parental consent "as evidenced by oath in case of a
license, and by the absence of any expression of <em>dissent</em>
in the case of banns;" and "from this date verbal contracts
of matrimony ceased to have any binding effect in
England; solemnization could not be enforced, and damages
for breach of promise, recoverable by action, became the
only relief in such cases."<a name="FNanchor_1415_1417" id="FNanchor_1415_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1417" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a></p>


<h3>III. THE PRESENT ENGLISH LAW</h3>

<p>There were, however, serious defects in the act of 1753.
It was conceived in a spirit of bigoted intolerance toward
Roman Catholics and all dissenters&mdash;save only Jews and
Quakers&mdash;who were thus forced against their consciences
to accept the rites of the established church; and the law
was far too rigid in matters of detail. The harsh treatment
of dissenters is all the more remarkable because "their
privileges were abridged" by the act; for previous to 1753
they had been at liberty to celebrate their marriages in
their own chapels, without submitting to the ritual of the
"church."<a name="FNanchor_1416_1418" id="FNanchor_1416_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1418" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> It is significant that in the report of debates
on the measure collected in the <cite>Parliamentary History</cite> not
a single voice seems to be raised in favor of the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
principle of toleration; though one ceases to be surprised
by this fact when he remembers the disfranchisement of
non-conformists and considers the shameful character of
parliamentary representation which was then drawn largely
from rotten or pocket boroughs under the control of a
corrupt oligarchy.<a name="FNanchor_1417_1419" id="FNanchor_1417_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417_1419" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> During more than fourscore years
repeated efforts were made in vain to gain relief for dissenters.<a name="FNanchor_1418_1420" id="FNanchor_1418_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1420" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a>
The Unitarians<a name="FNanchor_1419_1421" id="FNanchor_1419_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1421" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a> were particularly active in the
struggle for religious and civil liberty. The bill of 1826-27
introduced by William Smith in their behalf is especially
worthy of notice, because in the committee it took the
form of a provision for civil marriage before a justice of the
peace, leading to a very lively discussion. The Marquis of
Lansdowne defended the measure, not merely in the interest
of the dissenters who by the existing law were forced to do
violence to their consciences, but also in behalf of the clergy
of the established church who should be relieved of the
necessity of administering a religious rite for those receiving
it only under compulsion.<a name="FNanchor_1420_1422" id="FNanchor_1420_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1422" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a> On the other hand, the bill was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
opposed, not only on the old ground of violating the sanctity
of matrimony, but also because the clergy, by being required
to proclaim the banns in such cases and to certify the same
to the justice, would thus suffer humiliation; and for the
reason that the proposal smacked too much of the revolutionary
ordinance of Oliver Cromwell.<a name="FNanchor_1421_1423" id="FNanchor_1421_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1423" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> Every attempt to
gain justice for the dissenters failed until finally a signal
victory for civil institutions was won in the epoch-making
statute of 1836.</p>

<p>The long struggle to remedy the formal defects of the
Hardwicke act met with somewhat earlier success. Much
injustice and inconvenience grew out of the provision that
banns must be proclaimed in churches or chapels where
hitherto they had "usually been published." A stop was
thus put to legal celebration in many places, especially in
London; and "it was found that even St. Paul's Cathedral
and Westminster Abbey were included in this prohibition,
as no publication of banns had ever taken place in them."<a name="FNanchor_1422_1424" id="FNanchor_1422_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1424" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a>
Accordingly in 1781 a marriage solemnized in Buerlyhill
Chapel, "erected in 1765 and then duly consecrated, and in
which divine service had been publicly and regularly celebrated
ever since, and wherein banns of marriage had been
often published and marriages celebrated previous to the
marriage in question," was annulled by the court of King's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
Bench.<a name="FNanchor_1423_1425" id="FNanchor_1423_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1425" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a> An act was immediately passed to validate such
marriages already solemnized;<a name="FNanchor_1424_1426" id="FNanchor_1424_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1426" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> and this was followed by
various other statutes to legalize later marriages of the same
kind.<a name="FNanchor_1425_1427" id="FNanchor_1425_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1427" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> More serious were the consequences of the clause
making the express consent of parent or guardian in case of
license absolutely essential to the valid marriage of minors.
Through disregard of this provision, and for various other
trivial deviations from the letter of the statute, many harsh
cases of injustice arose. "A man was enabled to marry a
woman solemnly in the face of the church, to live with her
and acknowledge her publicly as his wife, and have issue by
her,&mdash;and 25 years afterwards to bring a suit for annulling
the marriage, on the ground that he himself had falsely and
fraudulently sworn, in order to obtain the license, that she
was 21 years of age, when she was in fact two months
younger."<a name="FNanchor_1426_1428" id="FNanchor_1426_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1428" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> In another case,<a name="FNanchor_1427_1429" id="FNanchor_1427_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1429" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> "where a father had gone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
America and was supposed dead, and the mother had given
her consent, but the father had no knowledge of the marriage,
it was declared void after eighteen years' cohabitation;"<a name="FNanchor_1428_1430" id="FNanchor_1428_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1430" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a>
for the father's consent, if living, was absolutely
necessary. Nullity was even declared in one instance<a name="FNanchor_1429_1431" id="FNanchor_1429_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1431" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a> "because
the testamentary guardians who had consented were appointed
by a will which turned out to be invalid because attested by
only one witness."<a name="FNanchor_1430_1432" id="FNanchor_1430_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1432" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a></p>


<p>At length, after the nullification of marriage on technical
or trivial grounds had become a "public scandal" and an
intolerable hardship to individuals,<a name="FNanchor_1431_1433" id="FNanchor_1431_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1433" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a> a remedy was found in
the act of 4 George IV., c. 76, by which so much of the
Hardwicke act as had not already been superseded<a name="FNanchor_1432_1434" id="FNanchor_1432_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1434" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a> was
repealed; and new and juster rules were substituted.<a name="FNanchor_1433_1435" id="FNanchor_1433_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1435" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> But
this statute, whose more important provisions will hereafter
appear, gave no relief to Roman Catholics or dissenters.
To effect this, after various futile attempts, the civil-marriage
law of 1836 was enacted,<a name="FNanchor_1434_1436" id="FNanchor_1434_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1436" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> simultaneously with another creating
a new system of registration.<a name="FNanchor_1435_1437" id="FNanchor_1435_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1437" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> These three measures,
with a few later modifications or additions, constitute the
present law of England relating to the celebration and registration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
of marriages. An analysis of their leading provisions
will now be presented.<a name="FNanchor_1436_1438" id="FNanchor_1436_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1438" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a></p>

<p>It will be convenient first to notice the main features of
the system of registration.<a name="FNanchor_1437_1439" id="FNanchor_1437_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1439" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> For the entire kingdom is
appointed by the lord treasurer and the lords commissioners
of the treasury a registrar-general whose office is in London
and Westminster. Below the general registrar of births,
deaths, and marriages are the "superintendent registrars,"
one in each union or parish, appointed by the Board of
Guardians of the Poor; or, in default of such appointment,
they may be nominated by the general registrar. The post
is usually filled, however, by the clerk of the Board of
Guardians. Below the superintendent registrars are the
registrars of the districts. These are of two kinds: the
registrar of births and deaths, appointed in the same way
as the superintendent registrars; and the registrars of marriages,
nominated by the superintendent of the union subject
to the approval of the guardians,<a name="FNanchor_1438_1440" id="FNanchor_1438_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1440" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> or of the registrar-general,
as provided by a later act.<a name="FNanchor_1439_1441" id="FNanchor_1439_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1441" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a></p>

<p>Co-ordinate with the civil registrars of marriages for the
district are the ministers of the Church of England, and the
ministers or accredited officers of other denominations, each
of whom is required every quarter to transmit abstracts of
all registrations to the superintendent, who, in his turn,
reports to the registrar-general. The division of the union
into districts, which usually correspond to the parishes, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
the duty of the guardians, subject to the approval of the
registrar-general.</p>

<p>Marriage within the Church of England is regulated by
the statute of 4 George IV., c. 76, and may be solemnized
in the parish church or a chapel licensed by the bishop,<a name="FNanchor_1440_1442" id="FNanchor_1440_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1442" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a>
after publication of banns for three successive Sundays at
morning service; or on production of the certificate of a
superintendent registrar, which is equivalent to banns.<a name="FNanchor_1441_1443" id="FNanchor_1441_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1443" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a>
Parent or guardian may forbid the marriage of minors, but
in case of banns express consent is not required. License
in place of banns may be granted by the archbishop, bishop,
or other authority, but only for solemnization within the
church of the parish in which one of the parties has resided
"for the space of fifteen days preceding." Before "a licence
can be granted an oath must be taken as to the fact of
residence;" that there is no legal impediment; and that the
consent of parent or guardian has been obtained, if either
of the parties is under twenty-one years of age.<a name="FNanchor_1442_1444" id="FNanchor_1442_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1444" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a> The
"marriage must be celebrated within three months after
banns or licence, and between the hours<a name="FNanchor_1443_1445" id="FNanchor_1443_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1445" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a> of eight and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
twelve in the morning."<a name="FNanchor_1444_1446" id="FNanchor_1444_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1446" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> Care is taken to avoid the hardships
arising from the rigidness of the Hardwicke act.
"The penalty of nullity" is "confined to the case of persons
wilfully procuring the celebration of marriage without due
publication of banns, or without a licence from a person
having authority to grant the same, or by any person not in
holy orders, or elsewhere than in a church or chapel wherein
banns" may "be lawfully published." The want of consent
of parent or guardian, in case of minors, does not invalidate
a marriage by license; but "in the event of any fraud
practiced to procure the contract, the guilty party" forfeits
"all property accruing from the marriage."<a name="FNanchor_1445_1447" id="FNanchor_1445_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1447" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a></p>

<p>The institution of banns, as already seen, is the ancient
device of the church to secure publicity.<a name="FNanchor_1446_1448" id="FNanchor_1446_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1448" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> During the ages
it has served a useful purpose, though from its very nature,
even under the most stringent regulations, it is capable of
serious abuse. But there are unmistakable signs that it has
about run its course and must soon yield to more effective
methods, such as those prescribed by the civil-marriage act.
The "unsuitableness of banns to the present state of society,"
remarks Mr. Hammick, appears as early as 1868 in the report
of the Marriage Law Commissioners,<a name="FNanchor_1447_1449" id="FNanchor_1447_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1449" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a> They say that "in
populous places it seems universally agreed that no real
publicity is obtained by banns, which afford no safe-guard
against improvidence, illegality, or fraud, and are frequently,
from their great number, an inconvenient and unseemly
interruption to divine service." The old sentiment against
publicity is a strong motive for evasion. "The evidence
which we have received," add the commissioners, "abundantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
proves that the dislike of this mode of publication
tends to promote clandestinity rather than to prevent it, by
inducing many persons to resort for marriage to places where
they are unknown."<a name="FNanchor_1448_1450" id="FNanchor_1448_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1450" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> Nor does the testimony against the
efficiency of banns come from lay sources alone. The bishop
of Durham, in this same report, declares that "at present
there is no punishment to any party making a false statement"
in order to have banns published in a parish where
he does not reside; "whilst it is quite impossible for the
clergyman, who is now by law punishable for celebrating
such marriages, to ascertain the falsehood of such statements,
as his time, if his parish be large, is entirely occupied
by his other necessary duties." Hence he believes that it
would be "advantageous to assimilate the law to that which
regulates the notice of banns at the registry, and to make a
false statement in either case perjury."<a name="FNanchor_1449_1451" id="FNanchor_1449_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1451" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a> In like spirit the
bishop of Ely refers to the difficulty of the clergyman's
making suitable examination. "All such inquiries," he says,
"are inevitably left to the parish clerk, whose interest it is
to inquire as little as possible. Hence, if any persons desire
to contract an illegal marriage, they choose one of the populous
parishes of our large towns, where they readily escape
notice."<a name="FNanchor_1450_1452" id="FNanchor_1450_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1452" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a> The uselessness of banns in such places is further
made very clear "not only by ninety-nine couples being
asked on one Sunday at St. Pancras, but also by 189 couples
being asked in the cathedral church at Manchester on the
11th December, 1864, and 202 couples on the 10th December,
1865," while on this last-named day at St. Mary's, Lambeth,
the banns of 125 couples were published. In many of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
cases, merely the names were mentioned, "unaccompanied
by any announcement of condition&mdash;whether bachelors,
widows," or spinsters.<a name="FNanchor_1451_1453" id="FNanchor_1451_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1453" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a></p>

<p>The civil-marriage act of 1836 owes its adoption mainly
to the influence and exertion of Lord John Russell, by whom
it was proposed. In a measure, however, the way had been
cleared for it by the bill of the preceding year introduced by
Sir Robert Peel. This was received in a spirit of conciliation
and compromise, showing that the period of harsh intolerance
was fast approaching its end.<a name="FNanchor_1452_1454" id="FNanchor_1452_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1454" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> The bill failed of passage,
mainly because as a half-way measure it did not satisfy the
non-conformists. For it permitted the civil form of marriage
only to those declaring their unwillingness to accept the
established rites; and thus, it was asserted, a stigma would
be put upon the dissenters to whom matrimony was not less
holy than it was to the adherents of the English church.<a name="FNanchor_1453_1455" id="FNanchor_1453_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1455" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a>
Moreover, the magistrate of the hundred before the marriage
was solemnized was required to send the certificate to the
clergyman of the parish for registration.<a name="FNanchor_1454_1456" id="FNanchor_1454_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1456" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> But it is highly
significant that in the debate proposals were made involving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
the essential elements of the two great measures of the next
year. A system of civil registration of births, deaths, and
marriages was suggested; while it was urged, either that the
civil form of solemnization should be made optional for all,
not merely restricted to non-conformists; or else it should
be made obligatory for all, leaving it free to the parties in
every case, after the lay ceremony, to avail themselves of the
rites of their own religious body.<a name="FNanchor_1455_1457" id="FNanchor_1455_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1457" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless the act of 1836 was adopted only after a
prolonged contest in the House of Commons.<a name="FNanchor_1456_1458" id="FNanchor_1456_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1458" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> By this
statute the religious celebration prescribed by the Anglican
rubric is preserved, and two additional methods of procedure
are created: (1) by certificate of the superintendent registrar
without license; (2) or by such certificate with a license.</p>

<p>When procedure is by the first method,<a name="FNanchor_1457_1459" id="FNanchor_1457_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1459" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a> notice must be
given "to the superintendent registrar of the district within
which the parties shall have dwelt for not less than seven
days" previous. This notice is then entered in a marriage
notice book "open at all reasonable times without fee to all
persons desirous of inspecting the same;" and thereafter
for twenty-one days the notice or a true copy is to be suspended
or affixed "in some conspicuous place in the office"
of the superintendent.<a name="FNanchor_1458_1460" id="FNanchor_1458_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1460" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a> "In the body or at the foot" of the
notice a "solemn declaration" as to residence, necessary
consent, and the absence of impediment of any kind must
be subscribed by one of the parties.<a name="FNanchor_1459_1461" id="FNanchor_1459_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1461" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> After twenty-one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
days,<a name="FNanchor_1460_1462" id="FNanchor_1460_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1462" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> if no valid objection be filed by parents or others, a
certificate is issued by the superintendent, and the marriage
may be celebrated at any time within three months of the
entry of the notice.<a name="FNanchor_1461_1463" id="FNanchor_1461_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1463" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> After issuing the certificate the marriage
may be celebrated in either of the following forms:
(1) Before the superintendent registrar, in the presence of
a district registrar and two witnesses&mdash;a mere declaration
of assent and no religious rites whatever being required.
(2) In any registered building by a minister of any sect
according to the religious rites of the same. Here also the
registrar of the district and two witnesses must be present.
(3) According to the rites of the Jews and Quakers in duly
certified buildings. A building may be registered by the
superintendent registrar on receipt of a written petition
from "any proprietor or trustee," accompanied by a certificate
signed in duplicate by twenty householders at the least,
that such building has been used by them during one year
at the least as their usual place of public worship and
that they are desirous that the place shall be registered.<a name="FNanchor_1462_1464" id="FNanchor_1462_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1464" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a>
(4) Marriages may also be solemnized by certificate in lieu
of banns in an Anglican church or chapel, if the consent
of the minister be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_1463_1465" id="FNanchor_1463_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1465" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> In all cases the place of marriage
must be mentioned in the certificate, and the celebration
must occur between the hours of 8 in the forenoon and
3 in the afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_1464_1466" id="FNanchor_1464_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1466" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>If the parties wish to avoid delay and so great publicity,
they may proceed by the superintendent's certificate and
license. These may be obtained on one<a name="FNanchor_1465_1467" id="FNanchor_1465_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1467" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> full day's notice to
the registrar of "the district in which one of the persons
resides, together with a declaration that he or she has
resided for fifteen days therein, that there is no impediment,
and that the necessary consents if any have been obtained.
The notice is not exhibited in the registrar's office."<a name="FNanchor_1466_1468" id="FNanchor_1466_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1468" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a> After
obtaining the license, the marriage may be celebrated in
either of the first three modes above mentioned; but no
superintendent's license may be issued for a marriage according
to the forms of the English church, that right being still
an "ecclesiastical monopoly." Any person guilty of wilfully
making any false statement in procuring certificate or license
is liable to the penalties of perjury;<a name="FNanchor_1467_1469" id="FNanchor_1467_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1469" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> and if any persons
"knowingly and willfully intermarry," in any place other
than that mentioned in the certificate or without notice, certificate,
or license, as required by law, or in the absence of
the registrar where his presence is required, their marriage,
except in certain specified cases, is null and void.<a name="FNanchor_1468_1470" id="FNanchor_1468_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1470" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a> False
statements as to consent subjects the offender to the penalties
of perjury, but does not invalidate the marriage.</p>

<p>As to the form of civil contract, it is only essential that
somewhere in the ceremony the following declarations be
introduced. Each of the parties must say:</p>

<p>"I do solemnly declare, that I know not of any lawful
impediment why I, A. B., may not be joined in matrimony
to C. D."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>And each must say to the other:</p>

<p>"I call upon these witnesses here present to witness that
I, A. B., do take thee, C. D., to be my lawful wedded wife
(or husband)."<a name="FNanchor_1469_1471" id="FNanchor_1469_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1471" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a></p>

<p>Thus English marriage ends, as it began, in a simple
contract; but the state has succeeded in imposing upon it
the condition of publicity&mdash;a task which the church first
attempted, but failed to accomplish.<a name="FNanchor_1470_1472" id="FNanchor_1470_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1472" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a></p>

marriage&mdash;the name given to the institution in Ceylon&mdash;"the young husband leaves
the family of his birth and passes into the family of his wife, and to that he belongs as
long as the marriage subsists. The children born to him belong, not to him, but to the
family of their mother. Living with, he works for, the family of his wife; and he
commonly gains his footing in it by service. His marriage involves usually a change
of village; nearly always (where the tribal system is in force) a change of tribe&mdash;so
that, as used to happen in New Zealand, he may be bound even to take part in war
against those of his father's house; but always a change of family. The man leaves
father and mother as completely as, with the patriarchal family prevailing, a bride
would do; and he leaves them to live with his wife and her family. That this
accords with the passage in Genesis will not be disputed." <cite>Patriarchal Theory</cite>, 42,
43. Nevertheless, in this case McLennan is certainly mistaken. We have here to do
with that form of wife-purchase called "marriage by service;" see <span class="smcap">Lichtschein</span>,

</p>
<p>
"Exchange of wives" is common among the Eskimo. "For instance, one man
of our acquaintance planned to go to the rivers deer hunting in the summer of 1882,
and borrowed his cousin's wife for the expedition, as she was a good shot and a good
hand at deer hunting, while his own wife went with his cousin on the trading expedition
to the eastward. On their return the wives went back to their respective
husbands." Sometimes in such cases the women are better pleased with their new
mates and remain with them. "According to <span class="smcap">Gilder</span> (<cite>Schwatka's Search</cite>, 197) it is
a usual thing among friends in that region to exchange wives for a week or two
almost every two months." <span class="smcap">Egede</span> (<cite>Greenland</cite>, 139) says such temporary exchanges
take place at festivals. So also at Repulse Bay, at certain times there is said to be
a "general exchange of wives throughout the village, each woman passing from man
to man till she has been through the hands of all, and finally returned to her husband."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Murdoch</span>,
"Point Barrow Expedition," <cite>IX. Rep. of Bureau of Eth.</cite>, 413. <i>Cf.</i>
<span class="smcap">Turner</span>, "Ethnology of Ungava Dist.," <i>ibid.</i>, 189. The loaning of wife or daughter
to a guest, or the prostitution of the wife for hire, appears among some South
American tribes: <span class="smcap">Martius</span>, <cite>Ethnographie</cite>, I, 118; <i>idem</i>, <cite>Rechtszustande</cite>, 65.</p></div>

fathers and relatives at a high price, and then to take them to a chief, who is considered
to be a priest, to deflower them and see if she is a virgin; and if she is not,
they have to return the whole price, and he can keep her for his wife or not, or let
her be consecrated, as he chooses." In the same connection, Castañeda says, "among
them are men dressed like women who marry other men and serve as their wives;"
and he describes also a curious kind of legal or consecrated prostitution existing
among the same people: see the translation of Castañeda's account in <span class="smcap">Winship's</span>

to this view, in early stages of development, that a child should be actually
begotten by the father. It is enough that it should be borne by his legal wife and be
accepted by him. Hence the <i>jus primae noctis</i>, exercised by a priest, king, or other

<p><a name="Footnote_147_147" id="Footnote_147_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> The first series of relationships is seen in the Arunta tribe, where "no man will
lend his wife to anyone who does not belong to the particular group with which it is
lawful for her to have marital relations&mdash;she is, in fact, only lent to a man whom she
calls <i>Unwana</i>, just as she calls her own husband, and though this may undoubtedly
be spoken of as an act of hospitality, it may with equal justice be regarded as evidence
of the very clear recognition of group relationship, and as evidence also in
favor of the former existence of group marriage." A native, it is true, will sometimes
lend his wife "as an act of hospitality to a white man; but this has nothing to
do with the lending of wives which has just been dealt with." It "does not imply
the infringement of any custom." The second relationship in the series named is of
a public nature, and it is strictly regulated by custom. It consists in the defloration
of a girl just before her marriage by certain men who have access to her in a definite
order. These men belong to forbidden groups; that is, groups into which the woman
may not marry. "The ceremonies in question are of the nature of those which Sir
John Lubbock has described as indicative of expiation for marriage;" and they may
be regarded as "rudimentary customs" pointing back to a stage of wider marital
rights than those which now exist in these tribes. The third relationship is the
license allowed on "occasions when a large number of men and women are gathered
together to perform certain corrobborees," the more important gatherings lasting
perhaps "ten days or a fortnight." Every day "two or three women are told off to
attend at the corrobboree ground, and, with the exception of men who stand in the
relation to them of actual father, brother, or son, they are, for the time being, common
property to all the men present." The explanations of similar usages advanced
by McLennan and Westermarck, such as phallicism, are deemed inapplicable to these
cases: <span class="smcap">Spencer and Gillen</span>, <cite>Native Tribes of Central Australia</cite>, 92-111. Compare
especially <span class="smcap">Kohler</span>, <cite>Zur Urgeschichte der Ehe</cite>, 64 ff., <i>passim</i>, who finds in the totem
groups and classificatory systems of relationship, existing in Australia, America, and
elsewhere, evidence of former group-marriage.</p></div>

Abschnitt</i>) he appeals to the mental processes of the child. The spaces, and consequently
the relationship, arise in the child's sense-perception, the impression
obtained by the infant soul of the relative distance or remoteness of persons belonging
to the different ages and generations. The very inadequate evidence adduced
for the former universality of such <i>Lager</i> arrangement (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sechster Abschnitt</i>) consists
(1) of the alleged customs of modern Asiatic hordes; and (2) the remains of ship-shaped
graves and dwelling-places discovered in various parts of the world. With
wonderful ingenuity the author is able to explain by his theory nearly every problem
connected with marriage and the family. Aside from the constructive part of his
work, his criticism of other writers, though often unjust and intolerant, is sometimes
acute and instructive.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_235_235" id="Footnote_235_235"></a><a href="#FNanchor_235_235"><span class="label">[235]</span></a> In his two earlier works McLennan is vague as to the exact meaning of "promiscuity"
and "polyandry;" but in his letter to Darwin (1874), <cite>Studies</cite>, II, 50-56,
he defines these terms, so that, in effect, he makes important concessions to the
adherents of early monogamy and polygyny and to those critics who have questioned
his theory of universal phases of progress. He says, referring to the first
series of <cite>Studies</cite>: "The import of my reasoning is that more or less of it [promiscuity]
and of <em>indifference</em> must appear in the hordes or their sections or some of
them." It is used to "denote the general conduct as to sexual matters of men
without wives.... Now I agree with you that from what we know of human nature
we may be sure that each man would aim at having one or more women to himself,
and cases would occur wherein for a longer or shorter time the aim would be
realized, and there would be instances of what we may call polygyny and monogamy&mdash;your
first stage.... I take it, polygyny, monogamy, and polyandry (or its
equivalents) must have occurred in every district from the first;" but the cases of
polyandry would be much more numerous. "Polyandry, in my view, is an advance
<em>from</em>, and <em>contraction</em> of, promiscuity. It gives men wives. Till men have wives
they may have tastes, but they have no obligations in matters of sex. You may be
sure polygyny in the early stage never had the sanction of <em>group opinion</em>." This
late explanation does not, however, relieve the author from responsibility for the
misleading statements or obscurities of his earlier works. <i>Cf.</i> the rather too appreciative
review of the second series of <cite>Studies</cite> by <span class="smcap">Professor Giddings</span>, in <cite>Annals

writer. "It has been suggested that the motive for the murder of female infants is
the fear of becoming the object of the predatory instincts of other tribes; whence we
must conclude that the tribe which keeps its women alive is tolerably strong; those
tribes which lack women cannot, therefore, obtain them by violence to any great
extent. It also seems to be a strange thing to kill the female infants from a dread
of being exposed to attack, and at the same time to seek to increase the number of
women by carrying them off by violence from other tribes."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, 132.</p></div>

are more males than females, the husband often has to fight for the retention of his
wife, though in exceptional cases she aids him in repelling the aggressor. The wife
is sometimes too ready to follow the victor, and in some cases the widow is very
easily consoled. "Vögel, deren Männchen getötet wurde, waren schon eine halbe

oder zum ausschliesslichen Geschlechtsverkehr." <i>Cf.</i> <span class="smcap">Heusler</span>, <cite>Institutionen</cite>, II,

he says, "ist nicht ein Verband von Blutsverwandten sondern eine Gemeinschaft der
Hausgenossen;" but the <i>Sippe</i> (<i>gens</i>) is based on blood-relationship (271). He
combats the view of <span class="smcap">Rosin</span>, <cite>Der Begriff der Schwertmagen</cite>, §5. Hellwald, as already

not find marriage proper until the stage of property and full "mother-right" is
reached; see chap. ii.</p></div>

vow, the husband may put her away, returning her property; but when the man is
guilty of this crime, or has even made himself suspected of it, his fate is worse; for
then all the women of the neighborhood troop together and fall upon the offender
with his possessions, who is lucky if he gets off with a whole skin. His landed
property, his house, and everything he has are completely destroyed. If the husband
does not bear himself humbly or friendly enough towards his wife, or if otherwise
she is no longer pleased with him, she abandons him and goes to her parents, who
then undertake the same work of destruction. Therefore many men are not willing
to marry, and they live with paid women."</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Bernhöft</span>, in <cite>ZVR.</cite>, IX, 417; and <span class="smcap">Lubbock</span>, <cite>Origin of Civilization</cite>, 14 ff., 159, regard
the couvade as a mark of transition. Such, in effect, is also the view of <span class="smcap">Lippert</span>,
<cite>Kulturgeschichte</cite>, II, 312; <cite>Geschichte der Familie</cite>, 213 ff., who believes the custom is
a form of redemption-sacrifice rendered by the father instead of the actual sacrifice
of the first-born child, a sacrifice exacted in the stage of earlier mother-right.
<span class="smcap">Hellwald</span>, <cite>Die mensch. Familie</cite>, 361 ff., accepts the theory of Lippert. On the
other hand, <span class="smcap">Tylor</span>, <cite>Early History of Mankind</cite>, chap, x, 297 ff.; <span class="smcap">Starcke</span>, <cite>Primitive
Family</cite>, 51, 52, 283, 284; and <span class="smcap">Dargun</span>, <cite>Mutterrecht und Vaterrecht</cite>, 18-26, hold that it
takes its rise in a supposed physical connection between father and child, and
therefore that it exists for the welfare of the child alone. <span class="smcap">Lubbock</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 14 ff.,
emphasizes this fact, while regarding the practice as an evidence of transition.
<span class="smcap">Tylor</span>, however, in his <cite>Method of Investigating Institutions</cite>, 254-56, accepts the view
of Bachofen and Giraud-Teulon, relegating the explanation first assigned by him to
a secondary place. <span class="smcap">Roth</span>, "On the Significance of the Couvade," <cite>Jour. Anth. Inst.</cite>,
XXII, 204-44, holds the custom to be a form of magic or witchcraft, resting on the
belief in a physical connection between the father and child, and so implying power
over the child. According to <span class="smcap">Crawley</span>, <cite>Mystic Rose</cite>, 416-28, the custom has its origin
in sexual taboo. It is a case of "substitution." The father simulates the mother
so that by exposing himself to the same danger he may help her and the child
against the magical or evil influences which are especially harmful in the great
sexual crises of human life. <i>Cf.</i> <span class="smcap">Kohler</span>, "Das Recht der Azteken," <cite>ZVR.</cite>, XI, 49;

essential point. The uterine system arises with the formation of families and
<i>gentes</i>. In a very primitive state, the natural means of subsistence sufficing, the
children leave the parents and look out for themselves; as it becomes more and
more difficult to find food and shelter, family groups are formed, and the children
remain a longer time with the mother. Hence naturally the name and kinship are
taken from her: "Ueber den Ursprung des Matriarchats," <cite>ZVR.</cite>, VIII, 378 ff. Compare

that the prohibition of intermarriage in the cases cited often extends far beyond the
local group; and secondly, because where the members of a <i>gens</i> do not at the same
time form a local community, marriage is not forbidden in the group of persons
actually living together. But Westermarck is dealing with origins; and he does not
mean to say that all the existing complex systems of kinship which have gradually
been developed through association of ideas or other influences actually now conform
to the principle for which he contends. On the other hand <span class="smcap">Hellwald</span>, <cite>Die mensch.
Familie</cite>, 178 ff., following <span class="smcap">Wagner</span>, in <cite>Kosmos</cite>, 1886, I, 21, 24-34, reaches a conclusion
essentially like that obtained by Westermarck. He finds the origin of exogamy in a
dread of close intermarriage producing a horror of incest. During the period of the
endogamous mother-group such marriages were the rule. With the rise of fixed
habitations for the group, beginning in the glacial age and carried farther in the
diluvial period, came more permanent sexual relations, the prototype of real
marriage. This close living together, because of its deadening effect on sexual
attraction, produced a dislike of unions in the group, leading to exogamy, often
accompanied by wife-capture; although neither rape nor exogamy must be regarded
as a universal stage of social evolution. <span class="smcap">Crawley</span>, <cite>Mystic Rose</cite>, 222, 223, 443 ff.,
rejects Westermarck's theory of a general human "instinct" against inbreeding.
He insists that neither incest nor promiscuity was "ever anything but the rarest
exception in any stage of human culture, even the earliest; the former being prevented
by the psychological difficulty with which love comes into play between
persons either closely associated or strictly separated before the age of puberty, a
difficulty enhanced by the ideas of sexual taboo, which are intensified in the closeness
of the family circle, where practical as well as religious considerations cause
parents to prevent any dangerous connections." Westermarck's theory, he holds,
does not account for all the facts; for example, "that to no little extent brothers
and sisters, mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, do <em>not</em> live together. This is
a result of sexual taboo, and is originally a part of the cause why such marriage is
avoided, and not a result of avoidance of incest." In short, it "is the application
of sexual taboo to brothers and sisters, who, because they are of opposite sexes, of
the same generation, and are in close contact, and for no other reasons, are regarded
as potentially marriageable, that is the foundation of exogamy and the marriage
system." <i>Cf.</i> <span class="smcap">Lang</span>, <cite>Social Origins</cite>, 10-34, 238-40 note, whose criticism of Westermarck
and McLennan follows similar lines; and <span class="smcap">Atkinson</span>, <cite>Primal Law</cite>, 209-40,
who believes that jealousy may have set up a bar to sexual unions within the "fire-circle"
before totems or the idea of incest arose.</p></div>

exclude sympathy."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, 362. "Civilization," he adds, "has narrowed the inner
limit, within which a man or woman must not marry;" while "it has widened the

latter of these processes has been one of vast importance in man's history."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>,

great number of examples of peoples among whom monogamy prevails does not
necessarily constitute proof of the original condition of man. It is possible, for
example, that the Veddahs are far advanced beyond their former condition, or, conversely,
that they are a degraded race. Still the existence of these examples of the
single pairing family among barbarous and savage men, as well as those found
among the anthropoid mammals, puts the burden of proof on the other side. At any
rate, it must not be lightly assumed that this kind of evidence has been used more
critically by the adherents of the theory of promiscuity than by those who take the
opposite view.</p></div>

capture in its various forms, will be found useful (<cite>Mutterrecht und Raubehe</cite>, 78 ff.,
92, 138, 139). They are divided into two major classes:
</p>
<p>
I. Peoples among whom wife-capture is an essential part of marriage. This
class comprehends three grades according to the consent of the guardian (<i>Gewalthaber</i>)
of the woman:
</p>
<p>
1. In the first grade fall peoples among whom wife-capture is customary without
any regard to the guardian: East Indians, Slavs, Germans, and various non-Aryan
peoples.
</p>
<p>
2. In the second grade fall peoples among whom it is the custom, after the
capture is effected, to compound with the guardian by paying a penalty for the
abduction or a price for the woman: including Slavs, Lithuanians, modern Greeks
of the Ionian Isles, the Ossetes of the Caucasus, the Germans, and certain non-Aryan
peoples.
</p>
<p>
3. In the third grade are peoples among whom the abduction of the bride, no
longer accompanied by actual violence, is a legal requirement, though preceded by
consent of the guardian. Besides non-Aryan examples, here are found the Romans,
ancient Greeks, Slavs, possibly the Germans.
</p>
<p>
II. Peoples among whom wife-capture exists as a survival in merely symbolical
form and without legal significance. Examples among nearly all peoples in every
stage of advancement.

With the Kalmuck case may be compared the following, communicated by
Dawson: "One day in 1872, when the writer was on the Ponka Reservation in
Dakota, he noticed several young men on horseback, who were waiting for a young
girl to leave the mission house. He learned that they were her suitors, and that
they intended to run a race with her after they dismounted. Whoever could catch
her would marry her; but she would take care not to let the wrong one catch her.
La Flèche and Two Crows maintain that this is not a regular Ponka custom, and
they are sure that the girl (a widow) must have been a 'mickeda,' or 'dissolute
woman.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dawson</span>, "Omaha Sociology," in <cite>III. Rep. of Bureau of Eth.</cite>, 260.</p></div>

especially in the form of violent abduction; and he is followed by <span class="smcap">Lubbock</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>,
111-13. According to <span class="smcap">Fison and Howitt</span>, <cite>Kamilaroi and Kurnai</cite>, 343 ff., women are
sometimes (1) stolen from kindred groups; (2) seized in war between related clans;
or (3) captured from alien tribes, elopement being of more frequent, and marriage
by exchange or gift of less frequent, occurrence. But it should be remembered that
elopement and purchase often go together. <span class="smcap">Mr. Curr</span>, <cite>The Australian Race</cite>, I, 108,
states that women are very seldom captured from other tribes, the practice being
discouraged for fear of stirring up incessant attacks. <i>Cf.</i> <span class="smcap">Westermarck</span>, <cite>Human

<span class="smcap">Spencer and Gillen</span>, <cite>Native Tribes of Cent. Australia</cite>, 104, 105, 554-60, name
four methods of obtaining wives among these aborigines: (1) charming by means of
magic; (2) capture, being of "much rarer occurrence;" (3) elopement, a form
"intermediate" between the method of charming and that of capture, often leading
to bloody fights; (4) the custom "in accordance with which every woman in the tribe
is made <i>Tualcha mura</i> [prospective mother-in-law] with some man. This relation
is entered into while the male and female are in tender years; so that the boy is
thus betrothed to the prospective, unborn daughter of his <i>Tualcha mura</i>. This is
the usual method of obtaining a wife in the Arunta and Ilpirra tribes.</p></div>

sexual attraction. The same is true of circumcision, 201-6; and of clothing, 186-212.
The facts "appear to prove that the feeling of shame, far from being the original
cause of man's covering his body, is, on the contrary, a result of this custom."
When not due to climate, it "owes its origin, at least in a great many cases, to the
desire of men and women to make themselves mutually attractive," 211. But see
<span class="smcap">Hellwald</span>, <cite>Die mensch. Familie</cite>, 60-96, who ascribes clothing, not to shame, but
the love of ornament; and <span class="smcap">Finck</span>, <cite>Primitive Love</cite>, 247 ff., who entirely rejects Westermarck's
view, alleging, as a matter of fact, that tattooing "has had from the earliest
recorded times more than a dozen practical purposes, and that its use as a stimulant
of the passion of the opposite sex probably never occurred to a savage until it
was suggested to him by a philosophizing visitor." On circumcision see <span class="smcap">Kohler</span>,

Among the Point Barrow Eskimo marriages are formed for "reasons of interest."
Sometimes a wife is taken against her will. Yet "women appear to stand on a
footing of perfect equality with the men both in the family and in the community."
The "wife is the constant and trusted companion of the man in everything except
the hunt, and her opinion is sought in every bargain or other important undertaking."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Murdoch</span>,

is 'their love for their wives and children; matrimonial disputes are rare, and wife-beating
unknown; and the intense grief with which the loss of a wife is mourned
is certainly not 'civilized,' for the widower will destroy all his stock and burn all
his possessions,' and possibly become careless of his life." A similar affection is
shown among the Eskimo, who are also polygynous: <span class="smcap">Wake</span>, <cite>Marriage and Kinship</cite>,

the power of veto, ostensible if not actual." During the preliminary courtship she
occupies a position of great dignity. "When all parties concerned are eventually
satisfied a probationary marriage is arranged, and the groom leaves his clan and
attaches himself to that of his bride. Two essential conditions&mdash;one of material
character and the other moral&mdash;are involved in this probationary union; in the
first place the groom must become the provider for, and the protector of, the entire
family of the bride." For a year he thus shows his "skill in turtle-fishing, strength
in chase, subtlety in warfare, and all other physical qualities of competent manhood....
During the same period the groom shares the jacal and sleeping robe
provided for the prospective matron by her kinswomen, not as a privileged spouse,
but merely as a protecting companion; and throughout this probationary term he is
compelled to maintain continence&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, he must display the most indubitable

<p><a name="Footnote_722_722" id="Footnote_722_722"></a><a href="#FNanchor_722_722"><span class="label">[722]</span></a> The marriage contract had already reached this last stage among the ancient
Babylonians and Assyrians. They had a remarkably high ideal of family life. The
facts disclosed by the records are wholly inconsistent with Herodotus's story regarding
the sacred prostitution of the unmarried women. At the nuptials it was customary
to state that the bride was "pure" or "without stain." Polygyny existed
only as the rare luxury of the rich. As a rule, the formation of a second marriage
was equivalent to a divorce from the first. Two principles, declares <span class="smcap">Sayce</span>, the
maternal and the paternal, "were struggling for recognition." Perhaps "they were
due to a duality of race; perhaps they were merely a result of the circumstances
under which the Babylonians lived. At times it would seem as if we must pronounce
the Babylonian family to have been patriarchal in character; at other times the
wife and mother occupies an independent and even commanding position. It may
be noted that whereas in the old Sumerian hymns the woman takes precedence of
the man, Semitic translation invariably reverses the order: the one has 'female and
male,' the other 'male and female.'"&mdash;<cite>Babylonians and Assyrians</cite>, 13. The practical
result was that the sexes were nearly equal in marriage. The individual and not
the family was the social unit; and the individuality of the woman was fully recognized.
She controlled her own property. She could buy and sell, borrow and lend,
sue and be sued, and inherit equally with her brother. She might become a
priestess, the head of a city, or the queen of the state. The wife was her husband's
equal in the business world. The possession of property "brought with it the enjoyment
of considerable authority." She "could act apart from her husband, could
enter into partnership, could trade with her money, and conduct law-suits in her
own name."&mdash;<i>Idem</i>, <i>Social Life among the Assyrians and Babylonians</i>, 50, 51. The
bride's dower was paid by her father to the bridegroom; but it was her property.
Sometimes the husband enjoyed the use of it for life; sometimes the wife disposed
of it as her private capital. It was always a means of securing her economic independence,
and thus of promoting the happiness of her married life. "In this way
she was protected from tyrannical conduct upon his part, as well as from the fear of
divorce on insufficient grounds. If a divorce took place the husband was required
to hand over to the wife all the property she had brought with her as dowry, and
she then either returned to her father's home or set up an independent establishment
of her own." The divorced woman might marry again if she chose. "Marriage
was partly a religious and partly a civil function. The contracting parties frequently
invoked the gods, and signed the contract in the presence of the priest. At
the same time it was a contract, and in order to be legally valid it had to be drawn
up in legal form and attested by a number of witnesses. Like all other legal documents
it was carefully dated and registered."&mdash;<i>Idem</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, 46, 47, 49, 50. <i>Cf.</i> for the
forms of contract and ceremony his <cite>Babylonians and Assyrians</cite>, 13-43; also the

freedom of divorce: (1) the marriage relation loose and dissoluble at the pleasure of
either party; (2) marriage indissoluble; (3) divorce only by mutual consent; (4) divorce
the right of the husband only; (5) divorce the right of the wife; (6) divorce
only on definite grounds, these grounds either being the same for either spouse or
different for the man and the woman respectively. In the text examples of the fifth
group are given in connection with the cases of divorce at the pleasure of either
party; for where the wife has the right to put away or leave the husband when she
likes, the husband, unless in very exceptional cases (<span class="smcap">Post</span>, <cite>Grundlagen</cite>, 271), appears
to have the same privilege with respect to the wife; hence Post's first and fifth
groups are practically the same.

husband to kill the adulterer outside the house, if it be in chase. But if the husband

a condition of setting the woman free he may demand the <i>lefdi</i>, or price of redemption,
and fix such other terms as he pleases; as that the <i>lefdi</i> shall be double
or triple, if she marry such or such a man. The sum may thus be so large as to
amount to a prohibition of marriage. On the other hand, a liberal price may be an
inducement to free the woman. Among some of these tribes the amount of the <i>lefdi</i>
is fixed by law, usually at a sum higher than the <i>thâmanth</i>, or purchase price of a
virgin or a widow, so as by working upon the cupidity of the husband to induce him
to pronounce the triple formula and thus suffer the woman to contract a new marriage.
The children under all circumstances follow the father.</p></div>

The fact that a marriage effected by rape or abduction is often treated as valid, even
when the purchase price is not paid, is especially urged as evidence of the survival
of customary wife-capture. Thus in <span class="smcap">Æthelberht</span>, 82, 83; <span class="smcap">Ælf.</span>, 8; <span class="smcap">Æthelred</span>, VI,

marriage appears to be valid. But is it not simpler to explain this on grounds still

of the tenth century: <span class="smcap">Schmid</span>, <i>Gesetze</i>, Anhang, VI, 390. It means the act of
"contracting" or "pledging," associated with the verb <i>beweddian</i>, "to contract":
<span class="smcap">Schmid</span>, 535, 536. It has the same origin as the modern "wed," "wedding," etc. On

is no contract by mere convention, no "consensual" contract. Originally two-sided
fulfilment was required. Thus, according to <span class="smcap">Sohm</span>, <cite>Eheschliessung</cite>, 24 ff., in case of
betrothal, payment of the price and tradition of the bride went hand in hand. Later
one-sided performance, or even a formal act, was deemed sufficient, and through it
the <em>title</em> was actually transferred; the purchaser thus acquiring the "negative" as
opposed to the "positive" rights of property&mdash;the power to use and enjoy. <i>Cf.</i>

<span class="smcap">Dahn</span>, <cite>Das Weib in altgerm. Recht und Leben</cite>, 4 ff., who absolutely rejects wife-purchase,
declaring such an idea to be "abominable and impossible" ("abscheulich
und unmöglich"). This theory is also held by <span class="smcap">Kraut</span>, <cite>Vormundschaft</cite> I, 171;
<span class="smcap">Schroeder</span>, <cite>Güterrecht</cite>, I, 27 ff., 38, 79; yet <span class="smcap">Schroeder</span>, <cite>Rechtsgeschichte</cite>, 68, 291 ff.,
regards the German marriage as in form a purchase of the bride. <span class="smcap">Rive</span>, <cite>Vormundschaft</cite>,
I, 258 ff., <i>passim</i>, denies that the betrothal has any relation to the <i>mund</i>, and
rejects entirely the view that the sale-marriage ever existed among the Germans.
<span class="smcap">Habicht</span>, <cite>Altdeutsche Verlobung</cite>, 8 ff., 12, admits that originally the <i>mund</i> was a
"property right" and the wife a "thing," though in the earliest written sources she

declares the betrothal to be a contract to "give the bride in marriage," or, more
directly, a "Kauf der Jungfrau." <span class="smcap">Friedberg</span>, <cite>Eheschliessung</cite>, 17, 18, appears to hold
that it was the <i>mund</i> which was conveyed; but elsewhere he seems to favor the
opposite view for the early period. See his <cite>Verlobung und Trauung</cite>, 7 ff.; <cite>Lehrbuch</cite>,
339; and <cite>Zur Geschichte</cite>, 362 ff. Pollock and Maitland, <cite>Hist. of Eng. Law</cite>, II, 362,
declare that "whatever guesses we may make about a remoter age, the 'bride-sale,'
of which Tacitus had heard, was evidently no sale of a chattel. It was very different
from the sale of a slave girl; it was a sale of the <i>mund</i>, the protectorship over
the woman." <span class="smcap">Gide</span>, <cite>Étude sur la cond. privée de la femme</cite>, 196-215, 335 ff.; and <span class="smcap">Henry
Adams</span>, <cite>Historical Essays</cite>, 31, are decidedly of the same opinion. <span class="smcap">Buckstaff</span>, in
<cite>Annals of Am. Acad.</cite>, IV, 234, doubts whether the German woman was ever looked
upon as a chattel; and <span class="smcap">Opet</span>, "Die erbrechtliche Stellung der Weiber in der Zeit des
Volksrechts," in <span class="smcap">Gierke's</span> <cite>Untersuchungen</cite>, XXV, takes a very favorable view of
woman's right of inheritance.

ancient arrangements for the transference of women from their fathers to their
matrimonial suitors, and for protecting the property in them against nefarious
aggressors," he declares, "must be referred the barbarous spirit in which the law
still persists in regarding a certain class of atrocious outrages on morality as mere
infringements of private right. We reflect with astonishment on the conduct of
our distant progenitors, who legalized traffic in womankind, but we persevere, so far
as law is concerned, in dealing with the seducer as though his offence were nothing
graver than a violation of personal privileges, for which a payment of money to one
of the injured persons is the appropriate penalty" (I, 42, 43).</p></div>

who concludes (75) that "Die Verlobung ist nicht Beginn der Ehe, aber die rechtliche

of the betrothal" and "constitutes the beginning of the marriage." <span class="smcap">Lehmann</span>, <cite>Verlobung

law, and reaches the analogous result (124, 125) that the "betrothal is a primary
and independent, the nuptials (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hochzeit</i>) a secondary and dependent, act for joining

Besides the normal or full marriage of free men and women, just described, the
law-books recognize concubinage, so-called "marriages" between the unfree, and
unions between the free and the unfree. The church, by giving them a sacramental
sanction, constantly strove to raise these irregular connections to the rank of genuine
wedlock. See especially <span class="smcap">Koehne</span>, "Die Geschlechtsverbindungen der Unfreien,"
in <span class="smcap">Gierke's</span> <cite>Untersuchungen</cite>, XXII, 1-23; and the literature on the subject mentioned

The kiss at betrothal appears to have been borrowed by the Christians from
older pagan custom, and it was first given legal importance by Constantine. If the
kiss were given, he provided that, in case one of the parties died before the nuptials,
the other party was entitled to inherit half the espousal donations: <cite>Cod. Theod.</cite>, lib.

England the priest joined in the ceremony of kissing at the nuptials. "In the

or use any such lyke ceremonies heretofore used &amp; observed in the Churche'":

plucked from a tree upon his own land, the bride thus being "symbolically bound to
the new locality": <span class="smcap">Unger</span>, <cite>Die Ehe</cite>, 106. The thread or band is interpreted as the
bond of the captive; and Kulischer gives the following illustration from northern
custom:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Komm, komm Maria lieb, und reich mir deine Hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hier hast du das Ringelein und um den Arm das Band,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">runs a Swedish rhyme. In an Upland dance, the maiden sings:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Und willst mich schliessen an's Herz dein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sollst mir zuvor geben ein Ringelein."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">To which the young man replies:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hier hast du Ring und Verlobungsband,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Du sollst mich nicht betrügen."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Sometimes these symbols are brought into connection with the sword&mdash;also, it is
assumed, a survival of violence. Thus in an Anglo-Saxon picture of the eighth
century the bridegroom reaches to the bride the ring upon a sword or staff: <span class="smcap">Kulischer</span>,

"This first part of the office was anciently termed the espousals, which took
place some time before the actual celebration of marriage. The espousals consisted
in a mutual promise of marriage which was made by the man and woman before
the bishop or presbyter and several witnesses; after which articles of agreement
of marriage (called <i>tabulae matrimoniales</i>), which are mentioned by Augustine,
were signed by both persons. After this the man delivered to the woman the ring
and other gifts, an action which was called <i>subarrhation</i>. In the later ages the
espousals have always been performed at the same time as the office of matrimony,
both in the western and eastern churches; and it has long been customary for the
ring to be delivered to the woman after the contract has been made, which has
always been in the actual office of matrimony."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Palmer</span>, <cite>Origines liturgicae</cite> (1839);

"Espousals" (<i>op. cit.</i>, I, 60-87) gives much information relating to ancient betrothal
customs. <i>Cf.</i> <span class="smcap">Brand</span>, <cite>Popular Antiquities</cite>, II, 87-98 (betrothal customs).</p></div>

contends, against the common interpretation of the maxim <i>consensus facit nuptias</i>,
that a merely "formless" <i>consensus</i> not followed by actual wedded life is not
sufficient to constitute a Roman marriage. That would be practically a <i>consensus
sponsalitius</i> or Roman betrothal. On the other hand, <span class="smcap">Sehling</span>, <cite>Unterscheidung der
Verlöbnisse</cite>, 7 ff., 138 ff., 157 ff., insists that by the Roman law a formless nuptial contract,
whether followed by cohabitation or not, constitutes a binding marriage.
Such also is the view of <span class="smcap">Dieckhoff</span>, <cite>Kirch. Trauung</cite>, 15; <span class="smcap">Schubert</span>, <cite>Die evangel.
Trauung</cite>, 4 ff., 11; and <span class="smcap">Scheurl</span>, <cite>Entwicklung</cite>, 11. But <span class="smcap">Scheurl</span>, "Consensus facit
nuptias," <cite>ZKR.</cite>, XXII, 269 ff., agrees with Sohm, in effect, though not avowedly.
For, while he says that marriage by <i>confarreatio</i>, for example, would be a valid marriage,
even if the parties never lived together, yet the Roman law, he points out,
does not reveal the evils of clandestine unions, because the formless nuptial promise
implied the common wedded life. <i>Cf.</i> also <span class="smcap">Bierling</span>, "Kleine Beiträge," <cite>ZKR.</cite>,

counsel concerning marriage rites, says concerning the nuptials: "First of all they
are placed in the church with oblations, which they have to make to God by the
hands of the priest, and so at last they receive the benediction and the heavenly
veil." On this letter see <span class="smcap">Selden</span>, <cite>Uxor ebraica</cite>, Lib. II, c. xxv, 179; <span class="smcap">Martene</span>, <cite>De

this letter and the statements of the Fathers concerning the benediction, already
mentioned, <span class="smcap">Meyrick</span>, in <cite>Dict. Christ. Antiq.</cite>, II, 1106, 1107, concludes, "There is no
reasonable doubt that the place in which Christians were ordinarily married was a
church, so soon as it became safe and customary for them to meet in churches for
religious purposes, and that the way in which they were ordinarily married was by
a religious ceremony," though especially in the East (<span class="smcap">Chrysostom</span>, <cite>Hom. xlviii, in
Gen.</cite>, c. 24) the religious ceremony often took place in houses. But so far as western
Christendom is concerned, the sources show that marriage in church was of slow
growth. <span class="smcap">Jeaffreson</span>, <cite>Brides and Bridals</cite>, I, 48, 49, doubts whether the Anglo-Saxons

at any rate unless the first marriage of one or both of the parties had not
been blessed by the priest; and long paragraphs of the service are devoted to
explaining the alleged reasons for this, and to the still harder task of showing how
a second marriage can be a sacrament and yet less holy than a first marriage.
This dilemma led to curious compromises, as in the service used at the marriage of
King Ethelwulf with Judith, his father's widow, in the year 856; see the service in
<span class="smcap">Pertz</span>, <cite>Monumenta, leg.</cite>, I, 420; and <span class="smcap">Dieckhoff</span>, <cite>Die kirch. Trauung</cite>, 73, 74. On this

That the <i>gifta</i>, or celebration as a temporal act, should take place before the
church door is thoroughly in harmony with the early view that there purification or
preparation should be made for the rites or service within the sanctuary. The
<i>atrium</i> sometimes seems to be regarded as the medial ground between the world on
the one hand and the sacred temple of God on the other; see, for example, <cite>Old Eng.
Homilies</cite>, I, 72, 73: children are to be baptized in holy church, "and their godfathers
and godmothers are to answer for them at the church-door, and enter into pledges
(covenants) at the font-stone, that they should be believing (faithful) men." This
passage is referred to in <span class="smcap">Mätzner</span>, <cite>Altenglisch. Sprachproben</cite> (Berlin, 1878), II, 578,
at "chirchedure." <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>, in his <cite>Pastoral Care</cite>, 104, 105, referring to the brazen
basins before the Temple supported by twelve oxen, says the bishops when they
"descend to wash the sins of their neighbors, when they confess, they support, as it
were, the basin before the church-door." According to the <cite>Capitula et fragmenta
Theodori</cite>, <span class="smcap">Thorpe</span>, <cite>Ancient Laws</cite> (folio), 313, "Si in atrio ecclesiae quislibet

Salic law. "When the bridegroom pronounces these words: '<i>De mon bien je vous
doue</i>,' he delicately places in the little purse of the bride three pretty pieces of
money, three new <i>deniers</i>. Not being able to put into her hands the fields, woods,
and manors constituting the dower, he gives her its symbol. They went so far on
account of this usage as to coin special <i>deniers</i>, 'deniers pour espouser'": <cite>La

166, from a Rouen ritual of the fourteenth century in Martene's collection. <span class="smcap">Dieckhoff</span>,
<cite>Die kirch. Trauung</cite>, 82 ff., takes a different view. The Rouen ritual, he holds,
is not a typical service. The priest does not now gain an essentially new function at
the nuptials. His office has always been necessary to a Christian marriage. In
addition to his original power of joining in wedlock, he merely adds the function
exercised by the father or guardian in the formal tradition. Moreover, Dieckhoff's
position is supported by some rituals, which seem to show that development on the
continent was not uniform in this regard. <i>Cf.</i> <span class="smcap">Scheurl</span>, <cite>Entwicklung</cite>, 110 ff., who
discusses the divergent views of Sohm and Friedberg.
</p>
<p>
The last stage of evolution has not yet been reached in the eastern church. In
the presence of the priest the bride and groom betroth and give themselves in marriage.
The priest merely prays and blesses: <span class="smcap">Sohm</span>, <cite>Zur Trauungsfrage</cite>, 19 ff.;

<p><a name="Footnote_1006_1006" id="Footnote_1006_1006"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1006_1006"><span class="label">[1006]</span></a> Thus the Hereford ritual simply says, after declaration of the dower, "et pater
vel propinquus mulieris accipiat eam, et tradat homini per manum dexteram"
(Surtees Society <cite>Publications</cite>, LXIII, Appendix, 116). Similarly the Pontifical of
Anianus, bishop of Bangor, of the thirteenth century declares, "Primo dicatur (dos)
feminae, deinde detur" (<i>ibid.</i>, 162); and this form agrees substantially with that of
the Hanley Castle Missal of the same period (<i>ibid.</i>, 163). In the ritual of the
fifteenth-century Harleian MS., in the British Museum, after asking the banns, "the
woman shall be given in this manner: Sacerdos utriusque manu dextera apprehensa,
jungat eos similiter, sicut faciunt qui fide se obligant" (<i>ibid.</i>, 166); but here, of
course, the words "jungat eos" are not words of power, for they precede the marriage
vow of the parties. According to the Welsh ritual of the fifteenth century,
"the woman is given by her father or by another friend" (<i>ibid.</i>, 167); and this form
is observed in the Sarum liturgy published both by <span class="smcap">Maskell</span> (<cite>Monumenta</cite>, I, 56),
and the Surtees Society (LXIII, Appendix, 19), while in one MS. of the same service
the words "deinde detur [Ecclesiae] femina a patre suo, vel ab amicis ejus" (<i>ibid.</i>,
<i>loc. cit.</i>, 19) appear, thus in effect agreeing with the form of the York manual. An
interesting variation occurs in the Pontifical of Magdalen College, Oxford, of the
twelfth century, where the priest does not <em>receive</em> the woman from her guardian,
but <em>joins with him</em> in giving her to the husband: "Sacerdos et patronus sponsae
dent ipsam sponso per dexteram" (<i>ibid.</i>, 160). A ritual of Arles (<i>ca.</i> 1300) affords
evidence of a similar transition in the form of tradition: see the extract in <span class="smcap">Sohm</span>,

contracted and consummated. The opposing view is thus set forth by
Pemberton in The Queen <i>v.</i> Millis: "In 1160 Pope Alexander issued edicts in
which marriages without the presence of a priest were declared good; but
almost immediately afterwards came the canons already cited [those of 1175 and 1200
mentioned in the text], to guard against the abuse of the permission thus given by
the pope. But from what follows it is clear that the law which admitted the canon
law in other countries, as part of the law of the land, was never adopted in England.
In 1253 the attempt was made to introduce the canon law of marriage recognized by
the popes, against the ecclesiastical law of England and the answer was the well-known
answer that the barons would not consent to have the laws of England
changed": 10 <span class="smcap">Clark and Finnelly</span>, 617. This is a strange perversion of the

<p><a name="Footnote_1032_1032" id="Footnote_1032_1032"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1032_1032"><span class="label">[1032]</span></a> The Council of Trent declared marriage to be a sacrament, but did not settle
the mediæval dispute as to the relation of its different elements. A strong party
held that it is necessary to distinguish between the contract and the sacrament. The
church might regulate the former and not the latter, for it was established by Christ
himself. This doctrine would logically have led to civil marriage, which the council
was not ready to sanction. "In every sacrament a distinction is made between the
minister, that is the agent who produces the sacrament, and its <i>materia</i>, the objective
or real content." From this distinction arose an important controversy; one party
regarding the priest, and the other the parties, as the minister of the sacrament.
According to the former theory, which was adopted by the French church, the bare
consent of the parties constituted the contract, and the marriage gained its sacramental
character later through the priestly benediction. The form of valid contract
as a temporal matter may therefore be determined by the state. As a direct consequence
of this doctrine in the eighteenth century civil marriage arose in France:
<span class="smcap">Friedberg</span>, <cite>Geschichte der Civilehe</cite>, 26-29; <i>idem</i>, <cite>Eheschliessung</cite>, 546 ff., 509 ff. <i>Cf.</i>

18 ff.; <span class="smcap">Esmein</span>, <cite>Le mariage en droit canonique</cite>, I, 78 ff.; II, 159 ff. The modern
Catholic church rejects the doctrine that there can be a distinction between the
contract and sacrament, the parties being the ministers of the sacrament. Yet in
effect a distinction is really made. The benediction, we are told, is not "necessary
in order to the validity of the sacrament; but it is the presence of the parish priest,
which is a necessary condition <i>sine quâ non</i> in order to the validity of the contract."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Humphrey</span>,

<i>ibid.</i>, XI, holding that the action of the Council of Trent regarding the
marriage contract is not dogmatic in character, and that hence the state, without
violating Catholic doctrine, may rightly institute a compulsory civil marriage form.

nature of the prevailing dogma, the Council of Trent anathematizes those who say
"that matrimony is not truly and properly one of the seven sacraments;" as well as
those who say "that the marriage state is to be placed above the state of virginity,
or of celibacy, and that it is not better and more blessed to remain in virginity, or in
celibacy, than to be united in matrimony."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Waterworth</span>, <cite>Canons and Decrees</cite>, 194,

this anomaly and with having debased the state of marriage which is right for all

the theory of impediments, and the invention of the sacrament of matrimony
have lowered the ideal of marriage which is an institution divinely ordained for all
men. He brings together in convenient form for reference a mass of extracts from
the teachings of the Fathers, the papal and conciliar decrees, the utterances of the

interesting book throws much new light on the position of woman in the Middle
Ages. The convent was a refuge from the "tyranny" of the family; and the author
believes that the desire for independence was a survival of the "mother-age."

early fathers of the church, and it was well established by the time of Augustine. At
the Council of Macon (585) the question, "Does woman possess a soul?" was seriously
discussed. "Upon one side it was argued that woman should not be called 'homo;'
upon the opposite side that she should, because, <em>first</em>, the Scriptures declared that
God created man, male and female; <em>second</em>, that Jesus Christ, son of a woman, is
called the son of man. Christian women were therefore allowed to remain human
beings in the eyes of the clergy, even though considered very weak and bad ones."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gage</span>,

Nevertheless for many this problem remained for centuries a topic for theological
debate. In 1595 appeared <span class="smcap">Acidalius's</span> <i>Disputatio nova contra mulieres, qua probatur
eas homines non esse</i>. In the same year it was republished, with an answer,
by <span class="smcap">Simon Geddicus</span> under the common title, <cite>Disputatio perjucunda, qua anonymus
probare nititur mulieres homines non esse: cui opposita est Simonis Geddici sacros.
theologiae doctoris defensio sexus muliebris</cite> (editio novissima, Hagae-Comitis, 1644).
At the end Simon writes: "Scriptum Halae Saxonum, 10. Februarii, Anno Filii Dei
nati, Hominis veri, ex Maria Virgine, homine vera, 1595."

Still later (1667) <span class="smcap">Feyerabend</span>, <cite>De privilegiis mulierum</cite> (3d ed., Jena, 1672), 2-5,

His theory is set forth in the <cite>Sententiae</cite>, lib. iv, dist. 27, 28: "Efficiens autem causa
matrimonii est consensus, non quilibet, sed per verba expressus: nec de futuro sed
de praesenti. Si enim consentiunt in futurum, dicentes, Accipiam te in virum, et ego
te in uxorem, non est iste consensus efficax causa matrimonii": dist. 27, § 3. "Consensus,
id est pactio conjugalis, matrimonium facit, et extunc est conjugium etiamsi
non praecessit, vel secuta est copula carnalis": dist. 27, § 4. The <i>consensus</i>, if
expressed by a verb of the present tense, <i>accipio te</i>, constitutes a valid marriage
without <i>copula</i>. Opposed to this is a promise, expressed by a verb in the future
tense, <i>accipiam te</i>, which is binding only when followed by <i>copula</i>. Compare

Magister Vacarius, who lived in England <i>ca.</i> 1148-98 and probably taught law
at Oxford, has a theory differing from that of Gratian or Lombard. According to
him, the "true act of marriage, the act which marks the moment at which the marriage
takes place, is the mutual delivery (<i>traditio</i>) of man and woman each to each.
Of course as a condition there must exist a pact of the appropriate kind....
Again, as a condition there must be the natural power of effecting a carnal union;
but the <i>carnalis copula</i> is unessential." The marriage is <em>made</em> by the tradition:
<span class="smcap">Maitland</span>, "Magistri Vacarii summa de matrimonio," <cite>Law Quart. Rev.</cite>, XIII,
136-38. In the same volume, 270-87, <span class="smcap">Maitland</span> publishes the text of the Summa.

that in their "content" the two kinds of <i>sponsalia</i> are identical; the one is
no more nor less a betrothal than the other, each looking to a subsequent perfected
marriage. The distinction is not "eine Unterscheidung verschiedener Thatbestände,

This passage was transcribed for me from a copy of the first edition (1541) in the
library of the British Museum by Professor William H. Hudson. To his kindness I
am also indebted for the extract from Whitforde's book taken from a copy in the
possession of the same library. In 1899 Sotheran offered for £4 10s. a "probably
unique" copy of a 24mo edition of Coverdale's work, 1543. This he regards as a copy
of the second edition, the title differing somewhat from that of the first edition.
An 8vo edition appeared also in 1543, with a preface by Becon. <span class="smcap">Friedberg</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>,
40, quotes the same passage; but the different spelling indicates that he has not used
the first edition.</p></div>

Howthon, of Tonbridge, was sentenced by the Consistory Court of Rochester to be
whipt three times round both market and church for having married Dionysia
Thomas, for whom his former wife had been godmother. The like spiritual relation
occasioned (Jan. 7, 1465) a dissolution of the marriage between John Trevennock
and Joan Peckham; Letitia, the former wife of the said John having been godmother
to a child of the said Joan." On December 29, 1472, William Lovelasse, of
Kingsdown, was cited to appear "on a charge of having married his spiritual sister,

Mention is made of registers in France as early as 1308; and by an order of Cardinal
Ximenes, 1497, they were to be kept in every parish of the diocese of Toledo "in order

<p>
There is some evidence, held to be inconclusive by <span class="smcap">Burn</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 5-15, that an order
for the use of registers may have been made earlier than 1538. The fact that at least
eight registers begin before that date points to instructions given at the time of the
suppression of the smaller monasteries: <span class="smcap">Waters</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 6. At the time of the insurrection
in Yorkshire, 1536, in order to draw the common people, it was given out
"that the king designed to get all the gold of England into his hands, under colour
of recoining it; that he would seize all unmarked cattle, and all the ornaments of
parish churches, and they should be forced <em>to pay for christenings, marriages, and
burials</em> (orders having been given for keeping Registers thereof), and for licenses to
eat white bread."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carte</span>, <cite>Hist. of England</cite>. See also the rare tract by Holmes

As a matter of fact, I find the consistory court of Wittenberg dissolving a
betrothal for lack of parental consent: <span class="smcap">Schleusner</span>, <cite>Anfänge des protest. Eherechts</cite>,
137. In another interesting case a girl was persuaded by her lover to marry him
without the consent of her mother or step-father, but saying: "I would not, however,
offend my dear mother." The two clerical judges held the contract to be conditioned
on getting the mother's consent, and therefore void, since the condition
had not been fulfilled and the law of Saxony forbade marriages without parental
consent. The two lay judges, however, held the contract binding, because the girl's
father being dead, to whom real authority belonged, she was free to marry whom
she chose. The case was referred to Luther and another person as arbiters. Luther,
in opposition to his associate, held the marriage void because conditional and a
violation of the fourth commandment, and the court accepted his opinion: <span class="smcap">Schleusner</span>,

bride, is that of Dr. Stiel, 1553. The plaintiff's petition (<i>Gesuch</i>) in fifty-eight articles
or specifications, setting forth in a most realistic way the whole courtship and the
betrothal proceedings, is communicated by <span class="smcap">Friedberg</span>, "Beiträge zur Geschichte des
brand.-preuss. Eherechts," <cite>ZKR.</cite>, VI, 72 ff. Actual force to compel the fulfilment of
a betrothal was used only when it was followed by <i>copula</i>: <i>ibid.</i>, 81. Friedberg
traces the history of the subject to the reign of Frederick the Great, citing various
cases. As a result he declares that in the sixteenth century betrothed persons could
be forced to keep their engagement even when both were willing to dissolve it;
while in the eighteenth century action depended upon the will of the interested parties:

Nevertheless by the middle of the seventeenth century was established a dualism
in effect similar to that which had existed under the later canon law. More
and more stress was placed upon the nuptials as compared with the betrothal,
although in theory the latter still constituted the marriage. <span class="smcap">J. H. Boehmer</span>, <cite>Jus
ecclesiasticum protestantium</cite> (Halle, 1714), whose teaching has mainly determined
the modern law, attacked Luther as being responsible for this dualism, holding that
a true betrothal, like the Roman <i>sponsalia</i>, is only a promise of future wedlock, and
may therefore be dissolved; while the nuptial contract, publicly and formally made,
is the true marriage. On Boehmer's doctrines see <span class="smcap">Dieckhoff</span>, <cite>Die kirch. Trauung</cite>,

of Caspar Beyer came before the consistorial court of Wittenberg in the latter part
of 1543; and its decision in 1544 led to the notorious controversy between Luther and
the jurists. Beyer wanted to marry Sibylla, a ward of Melanchthon, but he had made
a clandestine contract with another woman without consent or knowledge of her
parents; although it was alleged that her brother had given <i>post facto</i> assent, the
parents being perhaps dead. Luther declared that such secret betrothals "sollen
schlecht keine Ehe stiften;" and in 1539 or 1540 a law of Saxony had forbidden them.
A decision of the consistory, following the doctrine of the canon law, sustained the
validity of Beyer's marriage; but after a "starke Predigt" and long insistence by
Luther it was overruled by the Elector: <span class="smcap">Mejer</span>, "Anfänge des Witt. Consistoriums,"

Such cases may be carried from the archdeacon to the bishop, then to the
archbishop of Canterbury or York, whose decision is final. By 25 Hen. VIII, c. 21:
<cite>Statutes at Large</cite>, II, 90, the archbishop of Canterbury is given a right of dispensation
similar to that formerly exercised by the pope. Chapter 19 of the same statute,
<i>ibid.</i>, II, 85-87; <span class="smcap">Gee and Hardy</span>, <cite>Documents</cite>, 195 ff., provides for the appointment of
a commission of thirty-two men to examine the whole body of canons in order to
determine which should be accepted as valid; but until the commission should conclude
its labors "such Canons Constitutions Ordinances and Synodals Provincial
being already made," not repugnant to the laws or customs of the realm, "nor to the
Damage or Hurt of the King's Prerogative Royal, shall now still be used and executed
as they were afore." No report was made by this commission; nor did the
<cite>Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum</cite> prepared by another commission, which was
provided for by 3 and 4 Ed. VI., c. 11: <cite>Statutes at Large</cite>, II, 295, ever take effect:

before dinner; Sir Thomas Lake, as Secretary of State, read the words from the book
of Common Prayer, in French, 'I Frederick take thee Elizabeth,' etc., after which
the Archbishop gave his Benediction: 'The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob, bless these Espousals, and make them prosperous to these Kingdoms,
and to his Church.' This appears to have been the whole of the office, and the
service was probably not longer in ordinary cases. In the Contract for the Princess's
marriage, executed the same day (Dec. 27), is a clause, 'Quòd Matrimonium verum
et legitimum contrahatur inter eos in Angliā ante initium mensis Maii, et interim
<i>Sponsalia legitima de praesenti</i>.' 'It would be no difficulty,' remarks Mr. Anstis,
Garter [Leland's <cite>Collectanea</cite>, V, 329-36], 'to show the antient custom of such Espousals

Tyndale accuses the pope of opposing God's law in denying marriage to
priests and by dispensations licensing concubinage for money, "as through Dutchland
every priest, paying a gildren unto the archdeacon, shall freely and quietly
have his whore, ... as they do in Wales, in Ireland, Scotland, France, and
Spain;" and in "England, thereto, they be not few which have" such licenses. When
the parishes go to law to make them put away their concubines, "the bishop's
officers mock them, poll them, and make them spend their thrifts and the priests
keep their whores still."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, 40, 41 n. 4, and the documents there quoted. <i>Cf.</i>

hands of the parish clergy, partly into the hands of secular judges. The former in
their decisions followed mainly the Roman law and the scriptural teachings under
the guidance of Luther and other great theologians; while the lay judges were
guided by the <i>corpus juris canonici</i>. Confusion arose; the law was carelessly and
ignorantly administered; and so a demand was made for special courts for matrimonial
questions. This resulted, generally, in the relegation of matrimonial causes
to the newly created consistories, composed partly of spiritual and partly of temporal
judges, who in practice followed the principles of the canon law and constituted
in fact ecclesiastical courts. Compare the very interesting decisions of the
consistory court of Wittenberg, already quoted, beginning soon after its formation,
in <span class="smcap">Schleusner</span>, <cite>Anfänge des prot. Eherechts</cite>, 130-62. It can scarcely be said that the
evils of matrimonial law and administration in Germany were very much lessened as
a result of the Reformation during the first two centuries after Luther. See the minute
investigation of <span class="smcap">Friedberg</span>, <cite>Eheschliessung</cite>, 177 ff., 186 ff.; and his <cite>Geschichte der

from his said woman, and due punishment otherwise taken for the offence therein."

According to <span class="smcap">Swinburne</span>, <cite>Of Spousals</cite>, 18 ff., both by civil and canon law, children
are infants until they have completed the seventh year; and "Spousals contracted
during Infancy are utterly <em>void</em>, whether the Infants themselves, or their
Parents for them, do make the Contract." After the close of that period such void
contracts may be ratified by express words or by deeds. On the other hand, spousals
contracted between infancy and the "ripe" years of twelve or fourteen are voidable
by either spouse when that age is reached. To express dissent divorce proceedings
are not necessary, although a divorce may be desirable to prevent future question.
Either party may cancel the contract by simply marrying another person; just as a
child-marriage may be ratified by words of consent or by simply living together as
husband and wife: compare <span class="smcap">Furnivall</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, xix-xxv; and <cite>The Lawes Resolutions

Members of the established church might solemnize their marriages before their own
clergy; but the Lutherans and Catholics were not allowed a similar liberty; they
must put up with the lay ceremony or accept the offices of a Reformed minister.
This law remained in force until 1795, when, under the Batavian Republic, obligatory
civil marriage was instituted, which is still in force in the kingdom of Holland by the
statutes of 1833: see <span class="smcap">Friedberg</span>, <cite>Geschichte der Civilehe</cite>, 10-12; and his more elaborate

notice of the religious wedding service. "Marriage," he notes, "likewise
solemnized by the English and Dutch reformed churches, without the use of the ring
or any ceremony, only an admonition precedes, directing how these married persons
should demean themselves each to other, and for that end those Scriptures read
hereunto most pertinent; as also a large discourse precedes, touching the institution
of this sacred ordinance, and those texts hereunto pertinent also read." He mentions
the marriage of a couple "who used the ring, and it was as long in solemnizing
as our marriages, but I saw no other ceremony used but the ring and joining hands;
after this concluded, all the bride's kindred, friends and acquaintances that are
present, or meet with her, kiss her, even in the Church, when groom leaves her, and
her own friends bring her near his house, when he meets, salutes her, and receives
her. Among the Lutherans I observed that they bowed always at the name of Jesus,
so often as it was used in the solemnity of their marriage, which was very often."&mdash;"Travels
in Holland, etc., 1634-5," <cite>Chetham Society Publications</cite>, I, 63, 64. It is
noticeable that Sir William says nothing of the civil-marriage ceremony, permitted
in some provinces at this time. Between 1580 and 1656, in many cities, the Lutherans
had gained the right to solemnize marriage according to their own rites: <span class="smcap">Friedberg</span>,

of the bishops: see particularly <span class="smcap">Milton's</span> "Likeliest Means to remove Hirelings
out of the Church," <cite>Works</cite>, III, 1-41: Sir Henry Spelman, he says, "proves that
fees exacted or demanded for sacraments, marriages, burials, and especially for
interring, are wicked, accursed, simoniacal, and abominable" (<i>loc. cit.</i>, 21). "Nor
did other abuses imputed to these obnoxious jurisdictions fail to provoke censure,
such as the unreasonable fees of their officers, and the usage of granting licenses and
commuting penances for money. The ecclesiastical courts indeed have generally
been reckoned more dilatory, vexatious, and expensive than those of the common
law."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hallam</span>, <cite>Const. Hist.</cite>, I, 115; <i>cf.</i> 454.

Marriages on account of <i>disparitas cultus</i> were prohibited. "Amongst the hinderances
of marriage note this also, that by Constitution of holy Church, marriage is
forbidden betwixt persons of divers Religions, as Jews and Christian" (59). It does
not appear, however, that such unions were invalid; nor is anything said of
"mixed" marriages. There was no action, as in Germany, to compel the fulfilment
of the <i>sponsalia</i> (54).</p></div>

was celebrated by William Jervis, D.D., before witnesses, and then follows this
entry: "That also the sd. marriage ... hath its consummation before John Lord
Berksted, Lord Lieutenant of the Tower of London" according to the act of parliament,
and before Sir Jno. Sedley of the county of Kent. Apparently this was a

<span class="smcap">Jeaffreson</span>, <cite>Brides and Bridals</cite>, II, 71, who affirms that usually the "wedding was
religiously solemnized in church, after or before the performance of the purely civil
affirmation in the magistrate's parlour, ... in accordance with the instructions of
the 'Directory of Public Worship;'" and it seems that the celebration was sometimes
conducted according to the Book of Common Prayer: <span class="smcap">Lathbury</span>, <cite>Hist. of the

The act of 3 H. VII., c. 2, <cite>Statutes at Large</cite> (Ruffhead), II, 69, provides that if anyone
take away against her will any woman, whether maid, widow, or wife, "having
substances, some in Goods moveable, and some in Lands and Tenements, and some
being Heirs apparent unto their ancestors," and marry her or cause her to be married
or deflowered, or in any way aid or abet the same, he shall be guilty of felony; and
the act of 39 Elizabeth, c. 9, <cite>Statutes at Large</cite>, II, 689, deprives such offenders of
benefit of clergy. Again by 4 and 5 Philip and Mary, c. 8, <cite>Statutes at Large</cite>, II, 515,
the abduction of a maid under sixteen is punishable by two years' imprisonment or
a fine to be fixed by the Star Chamber; while the taking away and marrying or deflowering
any woman child under that age is punishable with five years' imprisonment
or a fine as in the first case. For these and the earlier statutes regarding rape
see <cite>The Lawes Resolutions of Womens Rights</cite>, 376-90.
</p>
<p>
These acts, it should be noted, are quite restricted in their range and besides,
by 1653, they seem to have become practically a dead letter; although in 1753 Attorney
General Ryder declares they are still in force: <span class="smcap">Hansard</span>, <cite>Parliamentary History</cite>,
XV, 3-5; and so does the act of 1650, c. 43: <span class="smcap">Scobell</span>, <cite>Acts and Ordinances</cite>, 151. On
the other hand, the act of the Commonwealth applies to all minors under twenty-one,
men or women, whether heirs or possessors of property or not; the penalties were
severe; and the fraudulent or forcible marriage is void.</p></div>

75-85, the record begins in 1654 after an interval of ten years; but his <cite>Registers of

In some books many entries are lacking, or there are breaks for several years
together. Often the record is so carelessly made as to be of little value, even when
not entirely illegible. Thus at St. Ewe, the "parishioners refusing to allow 5s. per
annum for keeping a register, there was none kept for the years 1675-6-7," except two
entries: <span class="smcap">Burn</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 41. The clerk of Plungar, Leicestershire, made use of the
registration book for wrapping paper; and <span class="smcap">Burn</span> gives many other similar illustrations

Milton does not anywhere discuss the <em>form</em> of solemnization (<i>cf.</i> <span class="smcap">Friedberg</span>,
<i>op. cit.</i>, 327, note). In his "Exposition on Places of Scripture which treat of Marriage"
(<cite>Works</cite>, III, 341-46), after considering the definitions given by many writers,
he produces one of his own. "Marriage," he says, "is a divine institution, joining
man and woman in a love fitly disposed to the helps and comforts of domestic life."
But he rejects the doctrine of the Fathers and canonists that marriage is a "remedy."
The "internal Form and soul of this relation is conjugal love arising from a mutual
fitness to the final causes of wedlock, help and society in religious, civil, and
domestic conversation, which includes as an inferior end the fulfilling of natural
desire, and specifical increase."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, 342.</p></div>

the priest often officiated. The great object was to avoid publicity. Hence churches
which were or claimed to be free from the visitations or oversight of the bishop
allowed marriage without banns or license. This became a lucrative source of
revenue. For example, in the church of St. James, Duke's Place, between 1664 and
1691, about forty thousand marriages were thus celebrated; and many were celebrated
at Trinity Minores: <span class="smcap">Burn</span>, <cite>Fleet Marriages</cite>, 2-5; <i>idem</i>, <cite>Parish Registers</cite>, 146;

These
chaplains "of course, married people after publication of banns in their own chapels
according to law;" and doubtless some of the weddings before them were entirely
respectable. Such was probably the marriage in the Fleet of George Lester and
Mistress Babbington as early as 1613: <span class="smcap">Burn</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 5; <span class="smcap">Ashton</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 335, 338;
<span class="smcap">Tegg</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 199. But in these chapels as well as out of them clandestine marriages
were solemnized. Here is an example from the <cite>Original Weekly Journal</cite> of Sept. 26,
1719: "One Mrs. Anne Leigh, an heiress of £200. per annum and £6000. ready cash,
having been decoyed away from her friends in Buckinghamshire, and married at the
Fleet chapel against her consent; we hear the Lord Chief Justice Pratt hath issued
out his warrant for apprehending the authors of this contrivance, who had used the

Symson, as he says, was not a prisoner. Like "many of his fellows," he was
witness in a bigamy trial in 1751. He was asked: "Why did you marry them without
license?"

<p>
"<i>Symson</i>&mdash;Because somebody would have done it, if I had not.... Never had

don't do it for lucre or gain.

"Another error, common amongst the lower orders, is, that a man may lawfully
sell his wife to another, provided he deliver her over with a halter about her neck.&mdash;And
another, that a woman's marrying a man under the gallows, will save him from
the execution. 'While we lay here (New York, A. D. 1784), a circumstance happened
which I thought extremely singular. One day, a malefactor was to be executed on a
gallows, but with a condition that if any woman, having nothing on but her shift,
married the man under the gallows, his life was to be saved. This extraordinary
privilege was claimed, a woman presented herself, and the marriage ceremony was
performed' (<cite>Life of Oulandah Equiano</cite>, vol. ii, p. 224).&mdash;If this took place, our

unions between the indigent and those morally unfit for the marriage relation: see
Bond's speech on the Hardwicke act, <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span>, <cite>Parliamentary History</cite>, XV, 46, 47.
But, of course, as Ashton suggests, the lighter expense may have induced respectable
people to seek the Fleet parson, or otherwise to marry privately. "A public marriage
had come to be a very expensive affair. There was a festival, which lasted
several days, during which open house had to be kept; there were the marriage
settlements, presents, pin money, music, and what not."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ashton</span>, <cite>The Fleet</cite>, 333,

</p>
<p>
In his speech against the Hardwicke act Mr. Nugent, to show how "fond our
people are of private marriages, and of saving a little money," says that in a year
six thousand were married in Keith's Chapel as against fifty in the neighboring St.
Anne's Church, in a populous parish and convenient for private marriages by
license, though the difference in expense was only 8 or 10 shillings: <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span>,

<cite>Eheschliessung</cite>, 346-48; and compare <span class="smcap">Burn</span>, <cite>Fleet Marriages</cite>, 11 ff. Three of
them introduced respectively in 1677, 1685, and 1691, may be found in the <cite>Reports of
the Historical Manuscripts Commission</cite>, IX, App. II, 91-99; XI, App. II, 276-80; XIII,
App. V, 253 ff. The first declares that "notwithstanding all provisions by law ...
several minors have ... been clandestinely married without consent of parents,
and other irregular marriages have been made;" therefore it is enacted that it
"shall not be in the power of any son, being under the age of twenty-one years, nor
... of any daughter ... under ... eighteen, to marry ... or to make a
matrimonial contract of any kind whatsoever;" except the father or guardian
"shall have given consent in writing attested by two credible witnesses at the least,
... or shall be present and consenting thereto," under penalty of nullity of the
marriage. After the death of father and mother, the same restriction is put upon
the contracts of males under eighteen and females under fourteen without the
guardian's consent. "If any guardian shall be privy to any such pretended marriage,"
he shall lose "all his right, title, and interest to the custody of any such
minors" and "shall also forfeit one moiety of his whole estate, both real and
personal," one-half to the king and the other to the informer. If "any domestic or
menial servant shall make any pretended marriage or matrimonial contract" with
"any of the children or pupils of his or her mistress during their minority, and in
such manner as ... is by this act declared to be ... null and void," such
servant shall suffer three years' imprisonment. "Every ecclesiastical person who
celebrates such a marriage or any marriage whatsoever whereof the banns had not
been published as required by the ecclesiastical law, shall be adjudged deprived
ipso facto of all benefices, dignities, pensions, and spiritual promotions which he
had at time of such offence or at any time after." Personating a priest in such
cases is constituted felony without benefit of clergy, punishable by death. For
violating the act in the issue of a license, the offender shall forfeit his office and be
incapable of holding office in church or state. The bill of 1691 is very similar in its
provisions.</p></div>

III., were especially bad. Before its enactment "it was in the power of any rogue
married at a tavern-wedding to inform against the officiating clergyman, without
rendering himself liable to punishment for his part in the irregular transaction.
Any clerk or other person who assisted at a marriage without license or banns, could
also with impunity turn informer against the lawless priest;" but by placing a penalty
on all these persons "the mouths of individuals who were best qualified and
most likely to give conclusive evidence against the peccant clergyman" were closed:

acquitted, even if he had ever been presented, as there was no real case against him,
and Mrs. Rawlins married him of her own free will."

In the <cite>Report of the Royal Commission, 1868</cite>, xxi-xxiii, it is estimated that one-third
of all the marriages in the eighteenth century were "irregular;" whereas,
after 1834, when the ministers of all denominations could solemnize, irregularity
became a "stigma," the number of such contracts now (1868) being in the ratio of
1 to 1,000.</p></div>

The first edition of this work appeared in 1730. It is strong evidence of the slow
progress of opinion on social questions that, a century after the enlightened legislation
of Cromwell, the author should have found it necessary to enter into an
elaborate argument to establish the right of the state to make the observance of
prescribed forms and conditions essential to a valid marriage. Sec. i assigns
"some general reasons for a law to annul clandestine marriages;" sec. ii presents
"what the civil law has done on this subject;" sec. iii shows "what has been done
in France;" and in sec. iv six objections to the adoption of such a law are answered.

not comprehended by the Hardwicke act; hence irregular marriages of royal persons
were still legal. On September 6, 1766, in a mansion in Pall Mall, Maria, Countess-Dowager
of Waldgrave, niece of Horace Walpole, contracted a clandestine marriage,
without witnesses, banns, license, or record, with the Duke of Gloucester, brother of
George III. Her private chaplain performed the ceremony; hence, except in form,
this was not strictly a Fleet marriage. A few years later, on Oct. 2, 1771, another
brother of the king, the Duke of Cumberland, formed a similar irregular alliance
with Anne Horton; but in this case there were a witness and a memorandum. Both
marriages were declared legal by a special commission: see the chapter of
<span class="smcap">Jeaffreson</span>, on "Two Royal Marriages," <i>op. cit.</i>, II, 234-49.</p></div>

had conceived for a measure that appeared to them an attempt to deprive them
of cheap and convenient marriage, with a view to preserve the children of the aristocracy
from the misfortune of premature and imprudent matrimony.... The
main object of the bill was, in the first instance, to abolish the law of matrimonial
pre-contract throughout the kingdom." Therefore Henry Fox, to render it unsatisfactory
to its promoters and "so ridiculous to the whole country," managed to have
Scotland exempted from the operation of the law, although the suit which gave rise
to the measure originated there: <span class="smcap">Jeaffreson</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, II, 183 ff.; <i>cf.</i> <span class="smcap">Burn</span>, <cite>Fleet

replies to the argument based on the laws of the Dutch. The people and the institutions
are very different from the English and therefore afford no precedent. "In
Holland not only every province but every town is a sort of sovereignty within itself;
and their religion, especially with regard to marriage, is much the same as it was in
this country in the days of Oliver Cromwell, when neither the marriage contract, nor
the ceremony was supposed to have any sanctity or religion in its nature." Then
follows this delicious bit of comparison: "The Dutch, sir, are naturally a cool,
patient people, and not given to sudden changes, either in their tempers or passions;
therefore the rendering a proclamation of banns necessary may do very well in that
country; but in this, where the people are naturally sanguine, impatient, and as apt
to change as the air they breathe, I am convinced that such a regulation would be
the cause of numberless mischiefs."</p></div>

other side, the Earl of Hillsborough asks whether even the "vulgar can believe, that
there is anything sacred in a ceremony performed in a little room of an ale-house in
the Fleet, and by a profligate clergyman whom they see all in rags, swearing like a
trooper and higgling about what he is to have for his trouble, and half drunk at the

him more happy, than if he had married the richest heiress in the kingdom; or

<p>
Mr. Nugent, in the Commons, appears to think that increase of population
among the poor must be promoted at all hazards. Even the judicially enforced
marriages between wenches and their reluctant seducers are blessings which he
fears the bill will put an end to: <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, XV, 18. With these conceits of
the opposition compare the sound views of the Earl of Hillsborough (<i>ibid.</i>, 63):
"Poor servants and labourers ... are but too apt to run into matrimony, before
they have considered how they are to support either themselves or their children
...; for the prosperity and happiness of a country does not depend upon having
a great number of children born, but upon having always a great number well
brought up, and inured from their infancy to labour and industry." Essentially
modern opinions are likewise expressed by Mr. Bond: "For as to those rash and
inconsiderate marriages ... between two poor creatures, sometimes before they
have got clothes to their backs" or a lodging or means of support, "I think they
ought all, if it were possible, to be prevented." Fleet marriages, he believes, have
propagated "beggars, rogues, and the most abandoned sort of prostitutes;" and he
appeals to the stricter laws of Holland which have not checked the growth of an
industrious population: <i>ibid.</i>, 46, 47.</p></div>

that date these parsons did a roaring good business. The <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>,
XXIV, 141 (Sunday, March 24, 1754), has the following:
</p>
<p>
"Being the last day before the commencement of the marriage act before 11
o'clock 45 couple were married at Mr. Keith's chapel, and when they ceased, near 100
pair had been joined together; two men being constantly and closely employed in
filling up licenses for that purpose." See Keith's appeal for charity, because the
act had reduced him "from a great Degree of Affluence" to "such a deplorable
state of misery in the Fleet Prison," in <span class="smcap">Ashton</span>, <cite>The Fleet</cite>, 364, 365.
</p>
<p>
Clandestine contracts, however, were not entirely put an end to by the Hardwicke
act. In the Savoy chapel Dr. John Wilkinson and his representatives solemnized
many hundreds of marriages contrary to the provisions of the law; but these
were, of course, absolutely void: <span class="smcap">Jeaffreson</span>, <cite>Brides and Bridals</cite>, II, 192-202; <span class="smcap">Burn</span>,
<cite>Fleet Marriages</cite>, 139-41. Burn is in error when he says (139) "there does not appear
to have been any clandestine marriages" at the Savoy "until after the Marriage Act."
Such a marriage took place there in 1596. Under date of June 14, in that year, W. Monne,
Master of the Savoy, writes to Lord Cobham, whose grandchild and ward was a
party to this contract, that he has "conferred with Archb. of Canterbury concerning
Mr. Bigge, the chaplain of the Savoy who performed the marriage. Bigge said he
thought he might well do it because his fellow chaplains were in the habit of marrying
people without license. Archb. committed Bigge to the Gate House pending
Cobham's pleasure, also ordered that 'no such disorderly marriage shall be
offensively in the Savoy performed.'"&mdash;<cite>Reports of the Hist. Manuscripts Commission</cite>,

Ireland, the proximate cause being the excitement aroused by the case of the Queen
<i>v.</i> Millis, 1843: see chap. vii, sec. ii, p. 316, above; and also <span class="smcap">Hammick</span>, <cite>Marriage Law</cite>,

In Scotland except as restricted by 19 and 20 Vict., c. 96, the principles of the
canon law are still in force, "subject only to such modifications as it has undergone
from time to time by the application of the rules of evidence established in that
country, and the course of judicial decisions" (<span class="smcap">Hammick</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 221). But in 1856
by 19 and 20 Vict., c. 96, called Lord Brougham's Act, for a contract to be valid, the
parties must have resided in Scotland at least twenty-one days preceding the ceremony.
This put an end to "Gretna Green" weddings, but otherwise private contracts
are still legal. Thus three kinds of marriages are recognized: (1) "regular marriages"
before a minister according to custom or statute; (2) "irregular marriages"
<i>per verba de praesenti</i>; (3) "irregular marriages" <i>per verba de futuro, subsequente
copula</i>; but in this case the contract must be written or proved by confession on
oath: <span class="smcap">Hammick</span>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 221 ff. That Scotch marriages are binding in England was
established by the celebrated judgment of Lord Stowell in Dalrymple <i>v.</i> Dalrymple
